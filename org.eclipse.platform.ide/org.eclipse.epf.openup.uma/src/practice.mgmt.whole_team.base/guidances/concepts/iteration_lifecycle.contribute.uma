Giving the team the ability and responsibility to organize their work and&#xD;&#xA;    determine how to best meet their commitments motivates team members to do their best. This also helps them collaborate&#xD;&#xA;    to ensure that the right skills are applied to the appropriate tasks. Self-organization impacts many areas, including&#xD;&#xA;    how planning and commitments are made (by a team, not by individuals), how work is assigned (you sign up rather than&#xD;&#xA;    get assigned), and how team members view their roles in the project (team member first, job function second).&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot;&#xD;&#xA;    href=&quot;./../../../practice.mgmt.whole_team.base/guidances/guidelines/self_organize_work_assignments_F47FC314.html&quot;&#xD;&#xA;    guid=&quot;_rmBEkJjsEduad8I_c-ogIA&quot;>Self-organization&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;requires a few things to work:&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul>&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li>&#xD;&#xA;        Transparency and commitments are crucial to aid in team communication and to bring out the best in the team&#xD;&#xA;        members. Open communication about the team's commitments related to the iteration lifecycle and personal&#xD;&#xA;        commitments made relative to micro increments ensures that execution problems are vetted and the right people are&#xD;&#xA;        focused on solving them.&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/li>&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li>&#xD;&#xA;        Coaching is required to help teams self-organize and to remove barriers for success. The assumption is that the&#xD;&#xA;        project manager is the coach. This requires that the project manager avoid a command-and-control style of&#xD;&#xA;        management in favor of a coaching style. This has been a key recommendation in management books for the last two&#xD;&#xA;        decades, but some project managers may still not be able to make that transition.&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/li>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul>" longPresentationName="new_concept,_SrioEE9wEd2FdckE7CIizQ"/>
