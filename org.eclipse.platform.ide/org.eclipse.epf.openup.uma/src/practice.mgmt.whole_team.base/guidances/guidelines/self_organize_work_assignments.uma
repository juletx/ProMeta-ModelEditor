Work selection is performed within given constraints, including the priorities set by&#xD;&#xA;        stakeholders, time (such as the length of the current work cycle, iteration or project increment), the budget, and&#xD;&#xA;        the skills of team members.&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/li>&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li>&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;b>Individuals select their own work.&lt;/b> Someone will choose to do something because they are good at it and know&#xD;&#xA;        that they can do the work effectively, because they want to gain more experience at something and hope to improve&#xD;&#xA;        their skills by working with someone with such experience, or because they know that the work needs to be done and&#xD;&#xA;        that it's their turn to do so. Although an individual fulfills one or more roles on a project team, that doesn't&#xD;&#xA;        imply that the person is constrained to doing only specific types of work.&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/li>&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li>&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;b>The team determines how to perform the work.&lt;/b> At the beginning of a work cycle, the team holds an &quot;all hands&quot;&#xD;&#xA;        planning meeting where it determines the general strategy for doing the work and the tasks required for that. More&#xD;&#xA;        detailed planning, if required, will be done on a just-in-time&amp;nbsp;basis by the individuals doing the work. Notice&#xD;&#xA;        that the team is still constrained by your organization's standards, technical infrastructure, regulations, and so&#xD;&#xA;        on.&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/li>&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li>&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;b>Everyone commits to the work.&lt;/b> The team commits to accomplishing the work that it has agreed to do by the end&#xD;&#xA;        of the&amp;nbsp;work cycle. Individuals also commit to doing the work that they say they will do in that cycle,&#xD;&#xA;        although as the&amp;nbsp;time progresses, various tasks may be renegotiated as required.&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/li>&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li>&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;b>The team coordinates regularly.&lt;/b> To ensure that the work is accomplished, the team must coordinate its&#xD;&#xA;        efforts effectively. This is typically done through daily standup (scrum) meetings of the team and impromptu&#xD;&#xA;        discussions between individuals.&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/li>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    This is a participatory approach to decision-making, where everyone has the opportunity to provide input and to listen&#xD;&#xA;    to the decision-making process. The goals are to make decisions at the right place within the organizational structure&#xD;&#xA;    and to empower teams by giving them both the responsibility and the authority to get the job done. Giving them control&#xD;&#xA;    over their work improves motivation among team members and, thereby, their productivity.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;h3>&#xD;&#xA;    Project manager responsibilities&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h3>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    There is still work for the project manager on self-organizing teams:&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul>&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li>&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;b>Provide leadership.&lt;/b> Team culture and project vision must be nurtured and must evolve throughout the project,&#xD;&#xA;        and direction must be provided to the team.&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/li>&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li>&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;b>Mediate disagreements.&lt;/b> The manager must be prepared to step in and make a decision when other team members&#xD;&#xA;        are unable to reach a decision.&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/li>&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li>&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;b>Ensure that team members increase their skill sets.&lt;/b> From time to time, the manager may need to motivate&#xD;&#xA;        individuals to take on new tasks that are outside of their comfort zones or to work with others to help those&#xD;&#xA;        people gain new skills.&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/li>&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li>&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;b>Ensure that the team respects their limits.&lt;/b> Self-organizing teams have the authority to make decisions&#xD;&#xA;        within the scope of their responsibility, but that doesn't mean that they get to rethink everything that they feel&#xD;&#xA;        like changing. For example, the development team must still conform to the technical infrastructure and to the&#xD;&#xA;        business strategy of your organization; they probably do not have the authority to change these things even though&#xD;&#xA;        they may not fully agree with them. When an issue falls outside of their scope of responsibility, the team must&#xD;&#xA;        either accept it or collaborate with the people with the appropriate authority.&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/li>&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li>&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;b>Summarize the project plan.&lt;/b> External stakeholders, such as senior management or business representatives not&#xD;&#xA;        actively involved with the team, will want to know the current status of the project and the team's current plans.&#xD;&#xA;        The project manager may be required to summarize and communicate this information to those people.&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/li>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;h3>&#xD;&#xA;    What &quot;self-organizing&quot; does not mean&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h3>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    The concept of self-organizing teams often sounds like anarchy or non-management to traditional IT professionals, but&#xD;&#xA;    this is not true. Although self-organization relies on team members being responsible and mature, it is tempered by the&#xD;&#xA;    guiding hand of a good project manager. It is also tempered by organizational standards, infrastructure, and external&#xD;&#xA;    regulations. &quot;Self-organizing&quot; doesn't mean that you have complete freedom to do what you want.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    Self-organization isn't necessarily a consensus-based approach either. Sometimes, individuals will disagree with a&#xD;&#xA;    decision but will choose to go along with the will of the team. Consensus decision-making isn't ruled out by this&#xD;&#xA;    approach. but it certainly isn't required.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>" longPresentationName="self_organize_work_assignments,_rmBEkJjsEduad8I_c-ogIA"/>
