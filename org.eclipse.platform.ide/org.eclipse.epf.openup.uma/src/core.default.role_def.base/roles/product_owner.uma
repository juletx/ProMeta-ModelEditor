The Product Owner has the responsibility of defining what is the right product to build,&#xD;&#xA;    determining the order in which features will be built, and making sure that the product actually works. The Product&#xD;&#xA;    Owner is responsible for defining the features of the product to be developed by the team in terms of:&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul>&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li>&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;strong>Functionality:&lt;/strong> Identifies each product requirement as a Product Backlog Item and supplies&#xD;&#xA;        details for those requirements when they are needed by the team, including specifying the acceptance tests for&#xD;&#xA;        each requirement&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/li>&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li>&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;strong>Priority:&lt;/strong> Defines the order in which those backlog items will be developed, according to the value&#xD;&#xA;        that they bring to Customers and users, which provides the team with a Product Backlog ready for Sprint/Iteration&#xD;&#xA;        planning&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/li>&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li>&#xD;&#xA;        &lt;strong>Goal:&lt;/strong> Defines the release goals and makes decisions concerning release planning&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/li>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    The Product Owner has the following responsibilities:&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul class=&quot;noindent&quot;>&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li>&#xD;&#xA;        Define the features of the product&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/li>&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li>&#xD;&#xA;        Decide on release date and content&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/li>&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li>&#xD;&#xA;        Responsible for the profitability of the product (ROI)&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/li>&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li>&#xD;&#xA;        Prioritize features according to market value&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/li>&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li>&#xD;&#xA;        Adjust features and priorities as needed&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/li>&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li>&#xD;&#xA;        Accept or reject work results&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/li>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    This person maintains the Product Backlog and ensures that it is visible to everyone. Everyone understands what items&#xD;&#xA;    have the highest priority, so everyone on the development Team knows what will be worked on.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    The Product Owner is one person, not a committee. Committees may exist that advise or influence this person but team&#xD;&#xA;    members who want to change an item's priority must first convince the Product Owner. In this way, organizational&#xD;&#xA;    methods for setting priorities and requirements are influenced over time by this role.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    For the Product Owner to succeed, everyone in the organization must respect their decisions. No one is allowed to&#xD;&#xA;    direct the development team member to work from a different set of priorities. Team members are not allowed to follow the direction&#xD;&#xA;    of anyone whose direction does not coincide with the direction provided by the Product Owner. The Product Owner’s&#xD;&#xA;    decisions are visible in the content and prioritization of the Product Backlog. This visibility requires that the&#xD;&#xA;    Product Owner do their best. Visibility makes the role of Product Owner both a demanding and a rewarding experience.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    The Product Owner is responsible for the first of the three Scrum ceremonies, Sprint/Iteration Planning. The development team evaluates&#xD;&#xA;    the prioritized Product Backlog, identifies the top priority items, and commits to completing the selected items during&#xD;&#xA;    a Sprint/Iteration. These items become the basis for the Sprint/Iteration Backlog.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    In return for the development team's commitment to completing the selected tasks, the Product Owner commits that they will&#xD;&#xA;    not introduce new requirements to the team during the Sprint/Iteration. Requirements are allowed to change but only outside the&#xD;&#xA;    Sprint/Iteration. After the team begins a Sprint/Iteration, it remains focused on the goals of that Sprint/Iteration. The only exception to this&#xD;&#xA;    rule is that a similar amount of work can be removed from a Sprint/Iteration to accommodate a new requirement.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>" keyConsiderations="The Product Owner's commitment is essential to ensure the project success.

This additional responsibility&#xD;&#xA;        may affect the Product Owner’s ability to work with stakeholders. However, the Product Owner can never be the&#xD;&#xA;        ScrumMaster.&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/li>&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li>&#xD;&#xA;        For commercial development, the Product Owner may be the product manager. For in-house development efforts, the&#xD;&#xA;        Product Owner can be the manager of the business function that is being automated.&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/li>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul>"/>
