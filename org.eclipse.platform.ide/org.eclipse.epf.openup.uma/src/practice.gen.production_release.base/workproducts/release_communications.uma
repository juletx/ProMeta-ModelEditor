In that case, this artifact should specify the different groups to which communications are directed, the method&#xD;&#xA;    of communication (e.g., email, text or pager message, bulletin, newsletter, phone message, etc.). All communiques&#xD;&#xA;    should be prepared in advance so that it is a matter of disseminating information when the release to production has&#xD;&#xA;    been determined to be successful.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    Also included in this artifact is a listing of the responsible parties who will execute the communications when a&#xD;&#xA;    successful release has been declared (normally the Deployment Engineer), as well as the timing and dependencies of the&#xD;&#xA;    communiques.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    While there is no prescribed format for the release communications artifact, each communique should indicate the&#xD;&#xA;    preferred delivery mechanisms (for example: beeper notification, telephone calls, a posting to an internal release&#xD;&#xA;    website, live or pre-recorded presentations by senior management, etc.). This artifact generally answers the following&#xD;&#xA;    questions:&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul>&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li>&#xD;&#xA;        Who are the parties (stakeholders) that are interested in knowing that a release to production has taken place?&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/li>&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li>&#xD;&#xA;        What specifically (features, functions, components) has been placed into production?&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/li>&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li>&#xD;&#xA;        Why is this release valuable to stakeholders and what business purpose does it serve?&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/li>&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li>&#xD;&#xA;        Where is the product available (on which platforms, geographical locations, business units, etc.)?&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/li>&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li>&#xD;&#xA;        How can the stakeholders access the system and under what circumstances?&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/li>&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li>&#xD;&#xA;        When was the product released (or when will it be released if the release date is in the future)?&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/li>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul>" longPresentationName="release_communications,_pQGOYGPoEeCXEsUUiTbOuQ" purpose="The purpose of this work product is to inform all the various stakeholders that a release to production has taken place and&#xD;&#xA;the implemented features are now generally available."/>
