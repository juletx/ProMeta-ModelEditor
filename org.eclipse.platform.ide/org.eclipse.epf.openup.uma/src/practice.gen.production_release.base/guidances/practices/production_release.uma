Release&#xD;&#xA;    preparation establishes a release baseline and produces all the necessary supporting material necessary to deploy (and&#xD;&#xA;    back out, if necessary) the release.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    Deployment involves the act of delivering the release into the production environment, verifying that the integration&#xD;&#xA;    of the release package into the existing environment was successful, and notifying all relevant stakeholders that the&#xD;&#xA;    features of the release are available for use.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    Unfortunately, there is little guidance available today regarding the practice of releasing to production. Although&#xD;&#xA;    there is wealth of information documented in the Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) set of process&#xD;&#xA;    books on this topic, those reference materials are used primarily by members of Production Support and IT Operations&#xD;&#xA;    organizations and not application development groups.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    This practice is designed to fill some of the void in this area for product development teams.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>" longPresentationName="production_release,_IAG5wOB-EeC1y_NExchKwQ" additionalInfo="&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    For additional information about Production Release, see:&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    Dean Leffingwell. &lt;em>Agile Software Requirements: Lean Requirements Practices for Team, Programs, and the&#xD;&#xA;    Enterprise&lt;/em>.

Sometimes, business operations are&#xD;&#xA;    interrupted or shut down because a release has somehow corrupted the production environment. Because the release&#xD;&#xA;    activity can have such a dramatic impact on the business, the purpose of the Production Release practice is to ensure&#xD;&#xA;    that the application developed is properly prepared to be released into production without any unintended consequences.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>" application="&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    The best way to read this practice is to become familiar with its overall structure, what is in it, and how it is&#xD;&#xA;    organized.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    Start with the tasks for preparing the release for production, then review the work products that result from those&#xD;&#xA;    tasks.

That is why a seasoned Deployment Engineer should execute these tasks.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>"/>
