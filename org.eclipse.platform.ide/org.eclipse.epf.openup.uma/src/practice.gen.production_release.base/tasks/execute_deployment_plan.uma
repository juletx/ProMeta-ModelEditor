If the deployment plan does not exist or it is poorly constructed, this task might be much more difficult.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    The main point here is that to achieve a high probability of success, the development team should have previously&#xD;&#xA;    developed a detailed plan that organizes and articulates all the unique instructions for deploying that particular&#xD;&#xA;    release. Because an experienced deployment engineer normally executes this task, they might be able to overcome any&#xD;&#xA;    missing deployment procedures or content. However, that is not an excuse for a development team to not develop the&#xD;&#xA;    plan's contents.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>" longPresentationName="02_02_execute_deployment_plan,_FCK_gWzvEeCPgecPbK9bdg" purpose="The purpose of this task is to ensure that the rollout is based on clear, validated, repeatable instructions and to reduce&#xD;&#xA;the risk of a deployment issue.">
