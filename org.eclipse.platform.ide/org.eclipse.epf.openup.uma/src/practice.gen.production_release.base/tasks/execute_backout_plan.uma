While the plan might&#xD;&#xA;have been written with good intentions, sometimes key procedures are missing or have not been thought out. The team backing&#xD;&#xA;out the release should be aware that blindly following the backout plan might not be the best approach. It is best to&#xD;&#xA;consider the unique circumstances within which the deployment has failed and rely on common sense and experience when&#xD;&#xA;executing the backout plan." longPresentationName="02_04_execute_backout_plan,_FCK_gGzvEeCPgecPbK9bdg" purpose="The purpose of this task is to remove a specific release quickly and seamlessly from the production environment because the&#xD;&#xA;release has caused problems or because it has been determined by the stakeholder community as unfit for service.">

However, the deployment engineer (or development team) must understand where the release went wrong&#xD;&#xA;    so that the code can be fixed before the next release attempt. This is a critical step, but it should be done quickly&#xD;&#xA;    so that the problematic release can be reversed before significant damage is done to the production environment.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    Log the issues as critical defects as soon as possible and assign those defects to the appropriate team members for&#xD;&#xA;    resolution.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>"/>

However, be aware that the backout plan&#xD;&#xA;instructions are a guide and should not always be taken literally. This interpretation is due to the fact that not every&#xD;&#xA;problematic condition can be documented in advance and because each real-world situation might be slightly different."/>

Because releases often take place at odd hours to&#xD;&#xA;minimize end user impact, use beeper-based notifications judiciously. In most cases, an email to key stakeholders (such as&#xD;&#xA;the product owner and program manager) might suffice. Following up with a phone call also might be warranted."/>
