If&#xD;&#xA;the problem(s) associated with the release can be fixed easily, and if they are not detrimental to the production&#xD;&#xA;environment, an emergency bug fix (EBF) might be the answer. In that case, the release is not backed out; rather, an EBF is&#xD;&#xA;scheduled to be executed as soon as possible."/>
