Often, the output of this task does not need to be&#xD;&#xA;    created from scratch; for products that plan multiple releases, just updating the communique details for each release&#xD;&#xA;    might be enough. However, if any of the stakeholder groups change, or there is a significant difference in the product&#xD;&#xA;    distribution, more significant content might need to be developed.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    In any case, communicating effectively to the end user community is important. A development team can develop high&#xD;&#xA;    quality software, but if messaging to the stakeholders is conducted poorly or not at all, the end user experience might&#xD;&#xA;    be degraded. By simply answering the questions &quot;who, what, when, where, why, and how&quot; in a format appropriate for each&#xD;&#xA;    stakeholder group, a product release can become a more satisfying experience for all those involved.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>" longPresentationName="05_develop_release_communications,_g-LLEDHNEeC7j_IRiP-WPQ" purpose="The purpose of this task is to create the content and criteria to identify who is notified and to describe how they are&#xD;&#xA;notified after a release is deployed successfully to the production environment.">
