This presents what the business users think about the way things are done in the company.&#xA;    They are linking words with statements with all the different semantic attached to them. The first activity focuses on&#xA;    analyzing this rule description&amp;nbsp;to extract&amp;nbsp;the business entities and terms used in a formal non ambiguous&#xA;    fashion.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/font>&lt;/span>&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xA;&lt;p>&#xA;    We are discussing about Business Term here, as reference to a business concept used in daily business operations.They&#xA;    are often found in different departments or refer to the same business concept from a different perspective: they are&#xA;    synonyms. A term may describe business concept which will be mapped to a Class, a characteristic of a business entity&#xA;    which will be mapped to attribute of a class, and sometime a term may describe the way a business object behave, in&#xA;    that last case it will be mapped within method of a final state machine.&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xA;&lt;p>&#xA;    The second concept presented in the analysis of rule is the Fact. Fact is a combination of terms that describes what&#xA;    business people know about their business. It connects terms into sensible business relevant observations.&lt;br&#xA;    style=&quot;MARGIN-TOP: 4.32pt; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; VERTICAL-ALIGN: baseline; DIRECTION: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed; TEXT-ALIGN: left; language: en-US; mso-line-break-override: restrictions; punctuation-wrap: simple&quot; />&#xA;    As stated by the SBVR specification meaning is built of concepts, questions and propositions. the concepts will build&#xA;    our underlying data model used by the executable rules, and the proposition will structure the data model and can also&#xA;    be mapped to rules.&lt;br />&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xA;&lt;p&#xA;style=&quot;MARGIN-TOP: 4.32pt; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; VERTICAL-ALIGN: baseline; DIRECTION: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed; TEXT-ALIGN: left; language: en-US; mso-line-break-override: restrictions; punctuation-wrap: simple&quot;>&#xA;    All these informations&amp;nbsp;help to build a&amp;nbsp;first logical data model used to build the underlying object&#xA;    model&amp;nbsp;used by the rules.
