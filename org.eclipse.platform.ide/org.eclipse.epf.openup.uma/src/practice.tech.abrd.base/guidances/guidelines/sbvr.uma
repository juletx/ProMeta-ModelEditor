SBVR is part of the OMG's Model Driven Architecture (MDA). The goal of SBVR&amp;nbsp;is to&amp;nbsp;capture&#xA;    specifications in natural language and represent them in formal logic so they can be machine-processed.&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xA;&lt;p>&#xA;    &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.omg.org/spec/SBVR/1.0/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>SBVR&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;includes two specialized vocabularies:&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xA;&lt;ul>&#xA;    &lt;li>&#xA;        &lt;p>&#xA;            Vocabulary for Describing &lt;em>Business Vocabularies&lt;/em> which deals with all kinds of terms and meanings.&#xA;        &lt;/p>&#xA;    &lt;/li>&#xA;    &lt;li>&#xA;        &lt;p>&#xA;            Vocabulary for Describing &lt;em>Business Rules&lt;/em> which deals with the specification of the meaning of business&#xA;            rules, and builds on top of the previous vocabulary.&#xA;        &lt;/p>&#xA;    &lt;/li>&#xA;&lt;/ul>&#xA;&lt;p>&#xA;    The meanings are declined into concept, question&amp;nbsp;and proposition. The meaning is what someone intends to express&#xA;    or understands. A phrase such as &quot;&lt;em>We deny the invoice if the medical treatment was done after one year of the&#xA;    accident&quot;&lt;/em> has a&amp;nbsp;clear meaning for a claim processor within a car insurance company. As analyst we need to&#xA;    transform logically this meaning into concepts which has a unique interpretation so that we can represent the business&#xA;    knowledge within a comprehensive vocabulary.&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xA;&lt;p>&#xA;    Concept includes a unique combination of characteristics or properties.&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xA;&lt;p>&#xA;    Business rules are declined into two possible classes:&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xA;&lt;ul>&#xA;    &lt;li>&#xA;        structural &amp;nbsp;(definitional) business rule which are&amp;nbsp;about how the business chooses to organize the things&#xA;        it deals with, they are considered as necessity. In this context the statements describing the rule can describe&#xA;        the necessity, the impossibility or the restricted possibility.&#xA;    &lt;/li>&#xA;    &lt;li>&#xA;        operative (behavior)&amp;nbsp;business rule govern the conduct of business activity. They&amp;nbsp;are considered as&#xA;        obligation and directly enforceable. When considering operative business rule it is important to look at the level&#xA;        of enforcement to specify the severity of action imposed by the rule in order to put or keep it in force.&#xA;        Statements to describe the rule include obligation, prohibition, and restricted permission.&#xA;    &lt;/li>&#xA;&lt;/ul>&#xA;&lt;p>&#xA;    In SBVR, rules are always constructed by applying necessity or obligation to fact types . Fact type is an association&#xA;    between two or more concepts.&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xA;&lt;p>&#xA;    Using SBVR the team can document the semantic of the business entities, facts and business rules. The persistence&#xA;    mechanism uses XMI to facilitate interchange between group and tools. SBVR allows multi-lingual development, since it&#xA;    is based on separation between symbols and their meaning. SBVR proposes Structured English as one of possibly many&#xA;    notations that can map to the SBVR Meta-model.&lt;br />&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xA;&lt;p>&#xA;    SBVR is a good fit&amp;nbsp;for describing business domains and requirements for business processes and&amp;nbsp;business rule&#xA;    applications.&#xA;&lt;/p>" longPresentationName="new_guideline,_1ZyHAHrZEd2l9d4UccBrvQ"/>
