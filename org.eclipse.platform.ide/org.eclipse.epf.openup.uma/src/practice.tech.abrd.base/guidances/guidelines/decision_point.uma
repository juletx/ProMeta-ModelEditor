A decision is a choice or a selection, is made after considerations, and results in action. When implementing&#xA;    decision with software we are looking at operational decisions related to operations like eligibility, validation,&#xA;    calculation, risk assessment, opportunity, etc... Those decisions involve worker's or subject matter experts'&#xA;    knowledge. The logic for making a decision should not be locked and therefore can be externalized to a business rule&#xA;    management system. The analysis of decision points start by the process analyst / business analyst working with Subject&#xA;    Matter Experts to understand how decision are done on a piece of information.&amp;nbsp;This analysis activity is done by&#xA;    doing the process modeling, or the business use case modeling. The search for mental thinking verbs like analyze,&#xA;    check, validate, evaluate, verify in the description of an activity can help identifying decision point, as well as&#xA;    looking and understand how data&amp;nbsp;are built. Looking at a business entity life cycle helps also identifying the&#xA;    decisions applied to change its state.&lt;br />&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xA;&lt;p>&#xA;    The type of decision will most likely be a reject or accept of the business event or flag it for future processing&#xA;    downstream in the business process. The decision may also include some computational expressions to assign value to&#xA;    attribute of the business transaction.&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xA;&lt;p>&#xA;    When there is a human task and conditional node you can expect to find decision point there. A human task can also&#xA;    being sub decomposed in an automatic task which performs the main stream of decisioning and an exception task&amp;nbsp;done&#xA;    by a human expert. In most business process there is the existence of validation step to ensure data quality: those&#xA;    steps are source for business rules.&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xA;&lt;p>&#xA;    &lt;br />&#xA;    It is recommended to define the interface of each decision point and then consider the implementation choice later.&#xA;    Using rule engine technology is the best choice when business users want to change the business logic over time, to&#xA;    enforce auditability, to trace the decisions done on a given business event. During the inception phase the project&#xA;    team is doing business modeling activities which aim at describing the business process and decisions applied to any&#xA;    business events supported by the application. Decision points are extracted at that moment and logged in the decision&#xA;    point table&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xA;&lt;p>&#xA;    When designing by services, a decision service is business service making decisions, so linked to decision points. A&#xA;    decision service can serve multiple decision points in a process, if they are sequentially related. Most likely a&#xA;    decision point will be mapped to one decision service. The implementation can use a BRMS rule engine, to support ease&#xA;    of change and adaptability. Decision service can be implemented in traditional software language, but will most likely&#xA;    be more efficient in rule engine language, because over time new decision criteria will be done.&lt;br />&#xA;    &lt;br />&#xA;    The process of designing, implementing decision service should not be thought as a one shot deal. This is a process&#xA;    which has to be managed over time, and well supported by a BRMS with the governance processes.&#xA;&lt;/p>&lt;br />&#xA;&lt;br />" longPresentationName="new_guideline,_yNUigIMUEd-68ahhmSUqHw"/>
