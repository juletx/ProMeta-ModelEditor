What XML is for&#xA;    syntax, RDF is for &lt;strong>semantics&lt;/strong> - a clear set of rules for providing simple descriptive information. RDF&#xA;    Schema then provides a way for those descriptions to be combined into a single vocabulary. RDF is integrated into a&#xA;    variety of applications including:&lt;br />&#xA;    &lt;br />&#xA;    * library catalogs&lt;br />&#xA;    * world-wide directories&lt;br />&#xA;    * syndication and aggregation of news, software, and content&lt;br />&#xA;    * personal collections of music, photos, and events&lt;br />&#xA;    &lt;br />&#xA;    The RDF specifications provide a powerful framework for supporting the exchange of &lt;strong>knowledge&lt;/strong> on the&#xA;    Web.&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xA;&lt;p>&#xA;    What's needed next is a way to develop subject - or domain - specific vocabularies. That is the role of an ontology. An&#xA;    ontology defines the terms used to describe and represent an area of knowledge. Ontologies are used by people,&#xA;    databases, and applications that need to share subject-specific (domain) information - like medicine, tool&#xA;    manufacturing, real estate, automobile repair, financial management, etc. Ontologies include computer-usable&#xA;    definitions of basic concepts in the domain and the relationships among them. They encode knowledge in a domain and&#xA;    also knowledge that spans domains. In this way, they make that knowledge reusable.&lt;br />&#xA;    &lt;br />&#xA;    OWL - the Web Ontology Language - provides a language for defining structured, Web-based ontologies which delivers&#xA;    richer integration and interoperability of data among descriptive communities. OWL uses both URIs for naming and the&#xA;    description framework for the Web provided by RDF to add the following capabilities to ontologies:&lt;br />&#xA;    &lt;br />&#xA;    * Ability to be distributed across many systems&lt;br />&#xA;    * Scalability to Web needs&lt;br />&#xA;    * Compatibility with Web standards for accessibility and internationalization&lt;br />&#xA;    * Openness and extensiblility&lt;br />&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xA;&lt;p>&#xA;    OWL and RDF implement an object-relational model allowing creation of a directed graph, a network of objects and&#xA;    relationships describing data. It is possible to infer new information from OWL and RDF data. Ex: if a container is for&#xA;    San Francisco then it is shipped to Oakland.&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xA;&lt;p>&#xA;    For Tim Berners-Lee who specifies the semantic web, rules constitute a key element of the semantic web, allowing&#xA;    integration, derivation and transformation of the data from multiple sources in a distributes, transparent and scalable&#xA;    manner.&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xA;&lt;p>&#xA;    Bringing semantic web into BPMS-BRMS practice offers rigorous data modeling combined with a rule engine to reason,&#xA;    classify and improve data quality.&#xA;&lt;/p>" longPresentationName="new_concept,_5Fm1kIZrEd25RvE15gqLvA"/>
