It shows the&#xD;&#xA;    trend for how much work is left to do within the iteration. This is accomplished by adding the estimated effort left&#xD;&#xA;    for each of the work items to be addressed within the iteration, and showing how the estimated effort is changing over&#xD;&#xA;    the duration of the iteration. The iteration backlog should be updated frequently, preferably daily.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    These factors affect the team's assessment of how much work remains:&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul>&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li>&#xD;&#xA;        Work that has been completed, which means there is less work remaining&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/li>&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li>&#xD;&#xA;        The developer responsible for a work item changes the assessment of effort required to complete the work item. This&#xD;&#xA;        should be expected, because you typically understand what it really takes to complete a task after you have done a&#xD;&#xA;        subset of the task. It is common for estimates of the work remaining to increase in the beginning of the iteration,&#xD;&#xA;        especially for inexperienced teams, because they often underestimate efforts. Expect estimates to continue changing&#xD;&#xA;        as teams become more experienced, but the modifications are upward as often as downward.&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/li>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    Daily or frequent updates of the iteration burndown report allow the team to react to changes. For example, changes can&#xD;&#xA;    include cutting the project scope by removing work items from the iteration, reducing the ambition level associated&#xD;&#xA;    with a work item, or finding better ways of approaching work items (such as having an expert team member help with&#xD;&#xA;    difficult work items).&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    See &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;&#xA;    href=&quot;./../../../practice.mgmt.iterative_dev.base/guidances/examples/iteration_burndown_report_example_1AE62791.html&quot;&#xD;&#xA;    guid=&quot;_GtGisDcGEdyTZ9G7ByfQTw&quot;>Iteration Burndown Report&lt;/a> for an example of an iteration burndown report.&lt;br />&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>" longPresentationName="iteration_burndown,_uAzgkDg3Edu4E8ZdmlYjtA"/>
