    The iteration burndown report is the primary tool for understanding the status of the current iteration. It shows the&#xD;
    trend for how much work is left to do within the iteration. This is accomplished by adding the estimated effort left&#xD;
    for each of the work items to be addressed within the iteration, and showing how the estimated effort is changing over&#xD;
    the duration of the iteration. The iteration backlog should be updated frequently, preferably daily.&#xD;
&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&#xD;
    These factors affect the team's assessment of how much work remains:&#xD;
&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&#xD;
    &lt;li&gt;&#xD;
        Work that has been completed, which means there is less work remaining&#xD;
    &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
    &lt;li&gt;&#xD;
        The developer responsible for a work item changes the assessment of effort required to complete the work item. This&#xD;
        should be expected, because you typically understand what it really takes to complete a task after you have done a&#xD;
        subset of the task. It is common for estimates of the work remaining to increase in the beginning of the iteration,&#xD;
        especially for inexperienced teams, because they often underestimate efforts. Expect estimates to continue changing&#xD;
        as teams become more experienced, but the modifications are upward as often as downward.&#xD;
    &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&#xD;
    Daily or frequent updates of the iteration burndown report allow the team to react to changes. For example, changes can&#xD;
    include cutting the project scope by removing work items from the iteration, reducing the ambition level associated&#xD;
    with a work item, or finding better ways of approaching work items (such as having an expert team member help with&#xD;
    difficult work items).&#xD;
&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
