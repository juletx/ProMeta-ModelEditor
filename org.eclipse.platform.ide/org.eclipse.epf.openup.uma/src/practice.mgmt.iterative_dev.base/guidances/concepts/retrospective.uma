A symbiotic relationship emerges between an evolutionary&#xD;&#xA;    development process and a Retrospective that supports the various methods of inspection and adaptation.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    The iteration, incident, and project Retrospectives are designed, in part, to calibrate the team's progress with the&#xD;&#xA;    goals of the project. Several methods can be used to incite the Retrospective team to begin their collective&#xD;&#xA;    investigative work, such as posing the following three driving questions to the team:&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul>&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li>&#xD;&#xA;        &quot;What worked well for us during the past iteration (or project, and so on)?&quot;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/li>&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li>&#xD;&#xA;        &quot;What did not work well for us during the past iteration (or project, and so on)?&quot;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/li>&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li>&#xD;&#xA;        &quot;What should we do differently, or what improvements should we undertake during our next iteration (or project, and&#xD;&#xA;        so on)&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/li>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    The questions are expected to generate actions that will assist the team in prioritizing suggested improvements for the&#xD;&#xA;    project, to be implemented during the subsequent cycle. In addition to the aforementioned investigative questions, a&#xD;&#xA;    Retrospective should include steps that provide structure for the team's focus and resulting work.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    An effectively facilitated Retrospective will create an environment that is conducive to various practices of&#xD;&#xA;    inspection and adaptation. The methods of inspection and adaptation are project control mechanisms that assume, and&#xD;&#xA;    respond to, the existence of complexity, unpredictability, and constant change. Practiced in the context of a&#xD;&#xA;    Retrospective, the methods of inspection and adaptation produce a feedback loop from which flexibility, responsiveness,&#xD;&#xA;    and reliability are realized.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    The mere execution of Retrospectives is insufficient without an organizational commitment to a collaborative culture.&#xD;&#xA;    The success of Retrospectives is directly proportional to, and necessarily contingent on, an environment that engenders&#xD;&#xA;    highly motivated and performing teams (not the individual), nurtures open and frequent communication, and provides a&#xD;&#xA;    thriving sense of dedication to the team community. Retrospectives embody the spirit of team collaboration and&#xD;&#xA;    self-reflection by offering an environment in which teams are encouraged to provide feedback and identify lessons&#xD;&#xA;    learned. The compositional aspects of the team are crucial in supporting the highly collaborative nature of&#xD;&#xA;    Retrospectives, enabling the team to produce insight(s) into improving the processes of the project.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>" longPresentationName="retrospective,_2PfbIA4QEdy2q5zsU8WDnA"/>
