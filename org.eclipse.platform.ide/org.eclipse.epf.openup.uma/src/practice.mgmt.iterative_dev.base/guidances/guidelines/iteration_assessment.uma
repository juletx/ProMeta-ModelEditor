    Practice&#xD;
&lt;/h3&gt;An iteration assessment is a short meeting (up to 4 hours) involving the team and stakeholders.&amp;nbsp;The solution&#xD;
increment is used as the focal point for brainstorming, and&amp;nbsp;for considering what functionality might be added in the&#xD;
next Iteration. It is a low ceremony meeting, so the team should not waste too much time preparing the demo and formal&#xD;
presentations. Preparations can, instead, be focused on making the demo fast-paced, and thinking about a good story to&#xD;
present the scenarios planned for the demo [&lt;a class="elementLinkWithUserText"&#xD;
href="./../../../core.tech.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.tech_6CCF393.html#STZ07"&#xD;
guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg"&gt;STZ07&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;br /&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br /&gt;&#xD;
The team should start the meeting by reviewing the iteration goal before presenting&amp;nbsp;the functionality. The demo should&#xD;
be kept at a business-oriented level, leaving out the technical details. It should be focused on what was&#xD;
accomplished&amp;nbsp;rather than how it was done. If possible, the audience should try to use the product. Minor bug fixes and&#xD;
trivial features should not be demonstrated, but just mentioned, because the audience&amp;nbsp;may lose focus on more important&#xD;
scenarios. Functionality that isn't &lt;span style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: rgb(255,255,255)"&gt;really completed (acceptance&#xD;
tested)&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;should not&amp;nbsp;be presented. &lt;br /&gt;&#xD;
&lt;br /&gt;&#xD;
Team members present the system functionality and answer stakeholders' questions. They also record changes, missing&#xD;
functionality, and&amp;nbsp;ideas for new features in the work item list. At the end of the presentation, the stakeholders are&#xD;
asked for their impressions and the priority of the changes. The potential rearrangement of the &lt;a class="elementLink"&#xD;
href="./../../../core.mgmt.slot.base/workproducts/project_work_slot_F12BAC46.html" guid="_1QZI8EfUEdyiPI8btkmvmw"&gt;[Project&#xD;
Work]&lt;/a&gt; is discussed with the team. Other points of discussion may include: &#xD;
&lt;ul&gt;&#xD;
    &lt;li&gt;&#xD;
        Were the defined goals and objectives met? Did the release meet its functionality and quality goals? Did the&#xD;
        release meet performance and capacity goals?&#xD;
    &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
    &lt;li&gt;&#xD;
        Were risks reduced or eliminated?&amp;nbsp;Were new risks&amp;nbsp;identified?&#xD;
    &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
    &lt;li&gt;&#xD;
        Were all planned work items addressed? What was the team's velocity relative to plan?&#xD;
    &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
    &lt;li&gt;&#xD;
        Did the end-users provide favorable feedback on what was built in this iteration?&#xD;
    &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
    &lt;li&gt;&#xD;
        Are any changes to the project plan required?&#xD;
    &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
    &lt;li&gt;&#xD;
        What portion of the current release will be baselined? What portion will need to be reworked?&#xD;
    &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
    &lt;li&gt;&#xD;
        Have there been external changes (such as changes in the marketplace, in the user community, or in the&#xD;
        requirements) that will affect the project plan?&#xD;
    &lt;/li&gt;&#xD;
&lt;/ul&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&#xD;
    stakeholders and the team may also agree that there is sufficient functionality in the system to provide immediate&#xD;
    business value, and they may decide to put the solution into production. In that case, discuss what deployment-related&#xD;
    work items should be added to the &lt;a class="elementLink"&#xD;
    href="./../../../core.mgmt.slot.base/workproducts/project_work_slot_F12BAC46.html"&#xD;
    guid="_1QZI8EfUEdyiPI8btkmvmw"&gt;[Project Work]&lt;/a&gt;.&#xD;
&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;h3&gt;&#xD;
    Value&#xD;
&lt;/h3&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&#xD;
    Iteration assessments provide an opportunity for everybody to learn about the solution being built, and obtain vital&#xD;
    feedback from stakeholders. It also forces the team to actually finish work and release it.&#xD;
