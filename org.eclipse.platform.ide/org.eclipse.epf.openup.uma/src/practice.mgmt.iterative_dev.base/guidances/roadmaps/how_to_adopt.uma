Each&#xD;&#xA;    increment adds a subset of the final system's functionality, and the system grows to become more and more complete over&#xD;&#xA;    the course of the project's iterations.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    Consider making all of your iterations have the same duration. This is important for two reasons: it establishes the&#xD;&#xA;    &quot;heart beat&quot; of the project, and it helps understand the project team's performance. This supports the creation of&#xD;&#xA;    successively more accurate estimates of remaining work. Attack the hardest problems on the first iterations, but do not&#xD;&#xA;    overload the first iteration too much. Make sure that you can show progress at the end of each iteration. Do not extend&#xD;&#xA;    an iteration in order to finish work, but also do not finish an iteration without any software to be demonstrated. If&#xD;&#xA;    needed, break the problem into smaller, more manageable pieces so that this balance can be achieved.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    Plan an iteration in detail only when it is due to start. Each iteration starts with an iteration planning meeting with&#xD;&#xA;    the whole project team. In this meeting, the objectives of the iteration are defined in terms of work items, tasks are&#xD;&#xA;    identified for these work items, and team members sign up for tasks and provide their estimates. At the end of the&#xD;&#xA;    iteration planning meeting, the iteration plan is comprised of a set of work items, decomposed into tasks that&#xD;&#xA;    individual team members sign up for. The iteration can be started. Once an iteration is under way, it should be allowed&#xD;&#xA;    to proceed according to its plan, with as little external interruption as possible.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    During the course of the iteration, team members provide frequent status of their tasks in focused meetings. The&#xD;&#xA;    frequency of these meetings is decided by team: it could be daily, a couple times a week, or weekly. Team members work&#xD;&#xA;    on the tasks they signed up for, following the appropriate priority. Allow detailed informal peer coordination to&#xD;&#xA;    happen, and mark completed work items in the iteration plan. The overall iteration status is hence readily available in&#xD;&#xA;    the iteration plan at all times. Any work items that have not been justifiably completed by the end of the iteration&#xD;&#xA;    are removed from the iteration and re-assigned to the next one (or just returned to the work items list).&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    Make all iterations follow the same pattern. This helps the team to focus on activities that are specific to the&#xD;&#xA;    beginning, middle, and end of an iteration. For example, some common activities performed during an iteration are:&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul>&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li>&#xD;&#xA;        Iteration planning&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/li>&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li>&#xD;&#xA;        Iteration architecture work&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/li>&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li>&#xD;&#xA;        Continuous development of micro-increments&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/li>&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li>&#xD;&#xA;        Creation of stable weekly builds&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/li>&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li>&#xD;&#xA;        Bug fixing&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/li>&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li>&#xD;&#xA;        Iteration review and Retrospective&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/li>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    See &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;&#xA;    href=&quot;./../../../practice.mgmt.iterative_dev.base/guidances/concepts/iteration_lifecycle_B16552E2.html&quot;&#xD;&#xA;    guid=&quot;_DI_tICNaEdyCq8v2ZO4QcA&quot;>Iteration Lifecycle&lt;/a> for more information.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;h3>&#xD;&#xA;    Common Pitfalls&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h3>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    There are common pitfalls experienced when adopting an iterative approach, including the ones listed in the following&#xD;&#xA;    sections. Fore more information on challenges when transitioning from waterfall to an iterative development approach,&#xD;&#xA;    see &lt;a class=&quot;elementlinkwithusertext&quot;&#xD;&#xA;    href=&quot;./../../../core.mgmt.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.mgmt_D80619F3.html#KRU00&quot;&#xD;&#xA;    guid=&quot;_JlTPUM6aEdyuBO4ZIzcyig&quot;>[KRU00]&lt;/a>.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;h4>&#xD;&#xA;    What project managers should plan for&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h4>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    One of the most difficult situations for project managers is to transition from a traditional development approach&#xD;&#xA;    (such as waterfall) to an iterative approach. There is more planning with iterative development than with waterfall:&#xD;&#xA;    one plan per iteration. At every iteration, there is negotiation with stakeholders, changes in scope, and re-planning.&#xD;&#xA;    Project managers need to avoid detailed planning upfront, and should work with their best estimates for the tasks at&#xD;&#xA;    hand in a given iteration.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    However, this behavior should not result in unplanned and non-prioritized requirements creating scope-creep, nor&#xD;&#xA;    unnecessary rework happening on elements that are not broken. The iteration plan, with iteration objectives and planned&#xD;&#xA;    tasks, should be collaboratively created by the project manager, the team, and stakeholders in order to promote a&#xD;&#xA;    common understanding and buy-in into what is expected at the end of an iteration.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;h4>&#xD;&#xA;    Which comes first: specifications or software?&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h4>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    In a waterfall approach, progress is often measured by the completion of specifications. For example, if the design&#xD;&#xA;    specification is completed and signed-off, the team advances to the implementation based on the design specification.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    With iterative development, artifacts evolve throughout the iterations, and every iteration should result in an&#xD;&#xA;    increment in the capabilities offered by the solution: in other words, implemented, tested software that is able to be&#xD;&#xA;    demonstrated (and potentially shipped) to customers. Software comes first. Planning is more important than the plans.&#xD;&#xA;    Designing and architecting an evolving solution is more important than capturing and polishing design and architecture&#xD;&#xA;    models. At the end of each iteration, perform an assessment to gauge the completion of requirements that have passed&#xD;&#xA;    test cases. Another way to make significant progress is by focusing on the harder problems (or risks) as early as&#xD;&#xA;    possible, thus making sure that you create and use a sound, executable architecture as the basis for the other&#xD;&#xA;    requirements.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;h4>&#xD;&#xA;    Different iterations for the different disciplines&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h4>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    A common problem found in organizations moving from a waterfall to an iterative process is that they use the iteration&#xD;&#xA;    concept only as an &quot;envelope&quot; for their engineering disciplines. For example, it is common to hear people in those&#xD;&#xA;    organizations talk about &quot;requirements iteration&quot; or &quot;test iteration&quot;. A fundamental tenet of iterative development is&#xD;&#xA;    that it takes a holistic view of work items: each work item assigned to an iteration is completed in that iteration.&#xD;&#xA;    For example, a &quot;Login User&quot; work item would see all required tasks (such as design, code, and test) to complete that&#xD;&#xA;    work item. At the end of the iteration, the Login User behavior can be demonstrated as an integral part of the&#xD;&#xA;    executable system.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;h4>&#xD;&#xA;    No visible progress&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h4>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    Some teams will have work items that are not completed during an iteration as expected, and will not report problems.&#xD;&#xA;    This creates a false impression that work items planned for the iteration are being closed, thus showing an inaccurate&#xD;&#xA;    iteration burndown.&lt;br />&#xD;&#xA;    In order to avoid this, monitor active tasks closely, and address any slippage promptly. Use frequent, short status&#xD;&#xA;    meetings to gauge progress and detect issues. Create a &quot;no blame&quot; environment where everyone feels empowered by the&#xD;&#xA;    team and actively seeks advice and help from the team.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;h4>&#xD;&#xA;    Adding work to an ongoing iteration&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h4>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    Management or stakeholders may impose more work to be added to an on-going iteration. While this is sometimes&#xD;&#xA;    legitimate (for business reasons), there is a risk that this work just gets informally accepted by the team, without&#xD;&#xA;    passing through the Work Items List, where it gets prioritized with the remaining work.&lt;br />&#xD;&#xA;    In order to minimize the impact of new work being added to an iteration, make sure to involve stakeholders in the&#xD;&#xA;    planning process, so that they understand the impact a new work item brings to the current iteration. Be prepared to&#xD;&#xA;    negotiate the removal of lower priority work from the iteration, in order to accommodate the new requested work.&#xD;&#xA;    Another approach is to convince stakeholders that in a few weeks the iteration will end (with demonstrable progress),&#xD;&#xA;    and that the new work item can be prioritized and assigned to the next iteration.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>" longPresentationName="how_to_adopt,_ERIDQOMPEdyM47cGD2jiaQ"/>
