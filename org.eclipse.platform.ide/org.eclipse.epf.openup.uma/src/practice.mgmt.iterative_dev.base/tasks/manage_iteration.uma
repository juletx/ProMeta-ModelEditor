When the team is falling behind, help the team assess how it can reduce work and still meet the&#xD;&#xA;    iteration goals.

Track the progress of the current&#xD;&#xA;    iteration by maintaining visibility on the status of the items that are being worked on during the iteration. In&#xD;&#xA;    particular, it is important to be able to understand how quickly the team is moving through the work scheduled for the&#xD;&#xA;    iteration, and how accurate the estimates were &lt;a class=&quot;elementlinkwithusertext&quot;&#xD;&#xA;    href=&quot;./../../core.mgmt.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.mgmt_D80619F3.html#LEF07&quot;&#xD;&#xA;    guid=&quot;_JlTPUM6aEdyuBO4ZIzcyig&quot;>[LEF07]&lt;/a>.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    Share information about the progress being made by having quick, frequent meetings with the entire project team. These&#xD;&#xA;    meetings are useful to understand what team members have accomplished since the last meeting, and what they plan to&#xD;&#xA;    accomplish before the next meeting. It also allows the team to identify any blocking issues. See &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;&#xA;    href=&quot;./../../core.mgmt.slot.base/guidances/guidelines/collaboration_guidance_slot_D3B8DD40.html&quot;&#xD;&#xA;    guid=&quot;_68JUYN8-Edyhmsbt0Xyl8A&quot;>[Collaboration Guidance]&lt;/a> for more information.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    Track the status of each work item by using visual indicators of state information (for example: defined, completed,&#xD;&#xA;    accepted) in a wall or automated tool. Since iterations are typically fixed in duration, another primary way to gauge&#xD;&#xA;    progress is to continuously monitor current status and also estimate how much work remains. Plot an iteration burndown&#xD;&#xA;    chart on a daily basis in order to visualize progress on a given iteration. This chart is plotted with the total&#xD;&#xA;    estimates for all the items that are not yet started and the estimated remaining effort for any item in progress.

This communication significantly lowers the risk of&#xD;&#xA;    disconnect between the development team and the stakeholders. The status provides the team with data they can use to&#xD;&#xA;    improve their development process.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    Besides the iteration status, the overall project status can be captured and communicated in a burndown report for the&#xD;&#xA;    whole project. This report should show the progress toward the release date, and should be updated at the end of every&#xD;&#xA;    iteration (when metrics, such as the team's velocity, can also be provided). This allows the team to predict what it&#xD;&#xA;    can accomplish on the remaining project iterations. Other metrics (such as number of test cases passed) can also be&#xD;&#xA;    used to present iteration and project status.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    Keep the status information visible to stakeholders and the project team at all times in a project workspace (walls or&#xD;&#xA;    automated tool), where stakeholders can come and experience first-hand the progress being made by the team.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>"/>

Work with the team and stakeholders to revise the Iteration Plan and, as&#xD;&#xA;necessary, reduce the emphasis on less critical tasks by postponing them to a subsequent iteration. In rare cases, if the&#xD;&#xA;iteration objectives still seem impossible to meet, the team might consider terminating the iteration or reformulating the&#xD;&#xA;iteration to a new objective."/>
