The team makes use of objective measures to the greatest extent possible. To assess that a given work&#xD;&#xA;    item is completed, the team ensures that the corresponding test cases were successfully run against it.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    The team prepares a demonstration of the features implemented at that point, so that during the iteration assessment&#xD;&#xA;    stakeholders can have a real sense of progress made. The team decides whether each developer should demonstrate the&#xD;&#xA;    features that they implemented, or if the project manager or senior developer demonstrates it all, with other team&#xD;&#xA;    members present to answer questions.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    In addition to the demonstration,&amp;nbsp;prepare reports that show project status, such as work burndown and test case&#xD;&#xA;    reports.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    These activities happen in preparation for the iteration assessment meeting with stakeholders that occurs on the last&#xD;&#xA;    day of the iteration.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>"/>
