Each&#xA;    role describes a set of activities and artifacts for which the role is responsible. Guidance is also given on how those&#xA;    roles collaborate.&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xA;&lt;p>&#xA;    stakeholders will find guidance on what they may expect from the software development team, and how the software will&#xA;    be created. OpenUP also describes the stakeholders' responsibilities, and states how they can best work with the&#xA;    development team to obtain software that meets their needs.&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xA;&lt;p>&#xA;    Software process engineers can use EPF Composer to extend and modify OpenUP. Modification may be as simple as altering&#xA;    templates for work products, or as sophisticated as adding activities necessary for creating software in your specific&#xA;    environment (such as audits for safety-critical systems). In addition to modifying method content, process engineers&#xA;    can add, change, or remove process flows to add organization-specific capability patterns.&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xA;&lt;p>&#xA;    OpenUP is appropriate for academic organizations also. As an open source process, it can serve as the basis for&#xA;    software engineering courses and, when combined with the EPF Composer, courses in software process engineering.&lt;br />&#xA;&lt;/p>" longPresentationName="new_supporting_material,_jd1tQMn9EdyuBO4ZIzcyig"/>
