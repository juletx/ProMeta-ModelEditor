Every discipline defines standard ways of&#xA;    doing the work it categorizes. Such standard ways are expressed by so-called &lt;b>reference workflows&lt;/b> described with&#xA;    &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../core.default.uma_concept.base/guidances/termdefinitions/capability_pattern_F5DDC5F.html&quot; guid=&quot;_2RUJACO4EdqaNq6Ptg8uyA&quot;>capability pattern&lt;/a>s, which define how the tasks categorized by the discipline work&#xA;    together (in the most generic way). These reference workflows are often used for educating and teaching practitioners.&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xA;&lt;p>&#xA;    Like other workflows, a discipline's reference workflow is a semi-ordered sequence of activities, presented as either a&#xA;    breakdown structure or an activity diagram performed to achieve a particular result. The &quot;semi-ordered&quot; nature of&#xA;    discipline workflows emphasizes that the discipline workflows cannot present the real nuances of scheduling real work,&#xA;    for they cannot depict the optionality of activities, or the iterative nature of real projects. Yet they still have&#xA;    value as a way for us to understand the process, by breaking it into smaller areas of concern.&#xA;&lt;/p>" longPresentationName="new_discipline_grouping,_UBqBMMn_EdyuBO4ZIzcyig"/>
