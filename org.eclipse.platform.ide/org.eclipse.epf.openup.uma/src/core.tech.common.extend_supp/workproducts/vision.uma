You can accomplish this by including only the most important&#xD;&#xA;    features and avoiding details of requirements.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    Projects that focus on product development might extend the marketing section and include a more detailed product&#xD;&#xA;    position statement that is based on their needs and research.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>" longPresentationName="vision,_0WVxcMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw" purpose="&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    This artifact provides a high-level basis for more detailed technical requirements. It captures the technical solution&#xD;&#xA;    by describing the high-level stakeholder requests and constraints that give an overview of the reasoning, background,&#xD;&#xA;    and context for detailed requirements. The vision serves as input for communicating the fundamental &quot;what and why&quot; for&#xD;&#xA;    the project and provides a strategy against which all future decisions can be validated.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    The vision should rally team members behind an idea and give them the context for decision-making in the requirements&#xD;&#xA;    area. The vision must be visible to everyone on the team.&lt;br />&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>" impactOfNotHaving="If you do not state a vision, stakeholders and the development team might have different expectations of the project. This&#xD;&#xA;can lead to cancellation of the project. Misunderstandings and miscommunication about the strategy can cause the project to&#xD;&#xA;move from the original vision and create discrepancies in stakeholder expectations." reasonsForNotNeeding="Use this artifact for all but trivial projects." representationOptions="&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    Typically, the vision is represented in a document. If key stakeholder needs are captured in a requirements management&#xD;&#xA;    tool, this part of the document can be generated by using reporting capabilities.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    If the vision serves a set of projects or an entire program, the overall vision might be divided into several vision&#xD;&#xA;    work products. In this case, the vision of the program brings the visions together by providing program-specific&#xD;&#xA;    content and referencing the subordinate visions.&lt;br />&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>"/>
