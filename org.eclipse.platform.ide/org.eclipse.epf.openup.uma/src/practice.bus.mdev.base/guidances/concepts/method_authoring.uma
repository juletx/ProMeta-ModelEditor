In many cases, projects fail because the team members don't understand the rules of collaboration. When you&#xA;        share a common set of rules, everyone works more efficiently because there is a common understanding of who does&#xA;        what.&#xA;    &lt;/li>&#xA;    &lt;li>&#xA;        New team members can join and can be productive almost immediately. There is minimal &quot;ramp up&quot; time.&#xA;    &lt;/li>&#xA;    &lt;li>&#xA;        When you document standard processes and then reuse those processes across projects, then you truly standardize&#xA;        your way of working, which can save you time (teams don't have to spend time figuring out what to do next) and&#xA;        money (you can standardize on a set of tools that have been optimized to support the process, and buying and&#xA;        maintaining a standard set of tools is cheaper than buying and maintaining a collection of different tools).&#xA;    &lt;/li>&#xA;    &lt;li>&#xA;        A standard set of terminology, artifacts, key activities, and so on makes it easy to consistently plan a method&#xA;        development project.&#xA;    &lt;/li>&#xA;&lt;/ul>&#xA;&lt;p>&#xA;    In some cases, having a documented process is a nice-to-have; however, in others, it is a requirement due to regulatory&#xA;    and standards compliance and process certification. In any case, a documented process can go a long way to increasing&#xA;    the efficiency, repeatability and predictability of the process.&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xA;&lt;p>&#xA;    Formally, a method includes both method content&amp;nbsp;and processes. However, it is quite common to refer to &quot;process&quot;&#xA;    in the general sense, where the process is assembled from method content.&#xA;&lt;/p>" longPresentationName="new_concept,_Bb4xMJ8eEd-1Fp7x64HaLA"/>
