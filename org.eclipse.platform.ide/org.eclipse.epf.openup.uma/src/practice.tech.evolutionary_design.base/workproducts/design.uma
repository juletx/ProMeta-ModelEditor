It communicates abstractions of&#xD;&#xA;    particular portions of the implementation.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    While architecture focuses on interfaces, patterns, and key decisions, the design fleshes out the technical details in&#xD;&#xA;    readiness for implementation, or as part of implementation.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    This product can describe multiple static and dynamic views of the system for examination.

In circumstances where a project involves applying well-understood, existing strategies for&#xD;&#xA;architecture and design, it is possible that you will not need a &lt;em>new&lt;/em> design. In those cases, you can simply refer&#xD;&#xA;to some existing design." representationOptions="&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    It is important that the author of this work product be able to analyze key decisions about the structure and behavior&#xD;&#xA;    of the system and communicate them to other collaborators. It is also important that these decisions can be&#xD;&#xA;    communicated at various levels of abstraction and granularity. Some aspects of the design can be represented by source&#xD;&#xA;    code, possibly with some extra annotations. But more abstract representations of the design will be at a higher-level&#xD;&#xA;    than source code.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    The more abstract representation could use various representation options. UML could be used either strictly or&#xD;&#xA;    informally; it is a preferred notation based on its rich semantics and broad usage in the industry. Other techniques&#xD;&#xA;    could be used to communicate the design. Or the design could use a mix of techniques as applicable.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    Whether you record these representations on a white board or use a formal tool is not governed by this process. But any&#xD;&#xA;    representation, whether characterized as formal or informal, should unambiguously communicate the technical decisions&#xD;&#xA;    embodied by the design.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>"/>
