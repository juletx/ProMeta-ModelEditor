This can take&#xD;&#xA;    various forms. It may include, for example, a textual description (a document), class diagrams of participating classes&#xD;&#xA;    and subsystems, and interaction diagrams (communication and sequence diagrams) that illustrate the flow of interactions&#xD;&#xA;    between class and subsystem instances.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    In a model, requirements realization is typically represented as a UML collaboration that groups the diagrams and other&#xD;&#xA;    information (such as textual descriptions) that form part of the realization.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; If using use cases, the&#xD;&#xA;    collaboration may be further stereotyped as a use-case realization.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    Note that there can be more than one realization of the same set of requirements.&amp;nbsp; This is particularly important&#xD;&#xA;    for larger projects, or families of systems where the same requirements may be designed differently in different&#xD;&#xA;    products within the product family. Consider the case of a family of telephone switches which have many requirements in&#xD;&#xA;    common, but which design and implement them differently according to product positioning, performance and price.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>" longPresentationName=",_T9FbYFRFEd2o7OqLaYh8nA"/>
