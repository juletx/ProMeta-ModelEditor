There should be a constant level of review to ensure that the decisions make sense within the area being&#xD;&#xA;    designed and in the design of the system overall. There also might be occasions where some area of design is reviewed&#xD;&#xA;    by a set of interested or knowledgeable parties, such as the architect who will verify that the design conforms to an&#xD;&#xA;    architectural decision or a developer who will be expected to implement the design.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    The design should be examined to ensure that it follows heuristics of quality design, such as loose coupling and high&#xD;&#xA;    cohesion. Responsibilities should be appropriately distributed to elements in ways that there are no elements with too&#xD;&#xA;    much responsibility and no elements that are left without any responsibilities. The design should be able to clearly&#xD;&#xA;    communicate the design decisions, yet not delve into concerns best dealt with during implementation of code.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    Ensure that the design follows any project-specific guidelines and conforms to the architecture. Modifications to the&#xD;&#xA;    design to improve it (based on issues identified in reviewing it) should apply &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;&#xA;    href=&quot;./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/guidelines/refactoring_F3D63EBD.html&quot;&#xD;&#xA;    guid=&quot;_YNx2sJ05EdyQ3oTO93enUw&quot;>Refactoring&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;to ensure that the design and any existing implementation of the&#xD;&#xA;    design continues to fulfill its responsibilities.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>Revisit the relationships between elements to improve the coupling in the design. Remove redundant relationships, try&#xD;&#xA;to make relationships unidirectional, and so forth. See &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;&#xA;href=&quot;./../../../practice.tech.evolutionary_design.base/guidances/guidelines/analyze_the_design_4C4750C0.html&quot;&#xD;&#xA;guid=&quot;__MnggPTdEduDKIuqTXQ8SA&quot;>Guideline: Analyze the Design&lt;/a> for more information. &#xD;&#xA;&lt;h3>&#xD;&#xA;    Refine the design&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h3>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    After creating an implementation that includes a set of collaborating elements, with the behavior and relationships&#xD;&#xA;    robust enough to pass developer tests, the design can be improved and transformed into a more robust and maintainable&#xD;&#xA;    system.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    The visibility of each operation should be selected to be as restrictive as possible. Based on walking through the&#xD;&#xA;    scenario, it should be clear which operations must be available to other elements in the design and which can be&#xD;&#xA;    considered behavior inside of the element that has the operation. Minimizing the number of public operations creates a&#xD;&#xA;    more maintainable and understandable design.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    With respect to parameters, the return value, and a description of how it perform the behavior, operations can be&#xD;&#xA;    detailed at a lower level that drives the actual implementation, or that detail might be left to be handled when&#xD;&#xA;    writing the code.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    Data attributes can be identified based on information needed to support behavior or based on additional requirements,&#xD;&#xA;    such as information to be presented to the user or transmitted to another system. Avoid indiscriminate domain analysis,&#xD;&#xA;    because there might be a great deal of data in the domain that is not needed to support the requirements. Data&#xD;&#xA;    attributes can simply be identified or they can be designed in detail, with attribute types, initial values, and&#xD;&#xA;    constraints. Decide on the visibility of the data attribute; operations to access and update the data can be added or&#xD;&#xA;    deferred until implementation.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    Generalization and interfaces can be applied to simplify or otherwise improve the design. Ensure that the use of these&#xD;&#xA;    techniques actually improves the design, rather than bogging it down with complexity. For example, common behavior can&#xD;&#xA;    be factored into a parent class through generalization or out to a helper class through delegation. The latter solution&#xD;&#xA;    can be more understandable and maintainable, because generalization is an inflexible relationship (see the section that&#xD;&#xA;    follows on inheritance).&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    The refinement of any portion of the design could include another pass through the design process. You might find that&#xD;&#xA;    what was initially identified as a single behavior of an element warrants a detailed walkthrough of the collaborating&#xD;&#xA;    elements to realize that behavior.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    When updating an existing design -- especially one that has had portions already implemented -- apply refactoring to&#xD;&#xA;    ensure that the improved design continues to perform as expected.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;h4>&#xD;&#xA;    Organize elements&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h4>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    In a design of any notable size, the elements must be organized into packages. Assign the elements to existing or new&#xD;&#xA;    packages, and ensure that the visibility relationships between the packages support the navigation required between the&#xD;&#xA;    elements. Decide whether each element should be visible to elements outside of the package.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    When structuring the design into packages, consider &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;&#xA;    href=&quot;./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/guidelines/layering_F169CF07.html&quot;&#xD;&#xA;    guid=&quot;_0gpkAMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw&quot;>Layering&lt;/a> and other patterns. Although all design work must conform to existing&#xD;&#xA;    architectural decisions, the allocation of elements to packages and possible updates to package visibility are of&#xD;&#xA;    significant architectural concern. The developer should collaborate with the architect to ensure that package-level&#xD;&#xA;    decisions are in accordance with the rest of the architecture.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    This guideline first talks about the identification and design of the elements and then about organizing the elements&#xD;&#xA;    into packages. However, this is not a strict order of events. There is nothing wrong with identifying a package&#xD;&#xA;    structure for the system and then populating that structure with identified elements, as long as the actual elements&#xD;&#xA;    identified are allowed to influence the resulting package structure. See the sections on identification and behavior of&#xD;&#xA;    elements in &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;&#xA;    href=&quot;./../../../practice.tech.evolutionary_design.base/guidances/guidelines/analyze_the_design_4C4750C0.html&quot;&#xD;&#xA;    guid=&quot;__MnggPTdEduDKIuqTXQ8SA&quot;>Guideline: Analyze the Design&lt;/a>.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;h4>&#xD;&#xA;    Identify patterns&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h4>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    Identifying &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;&#xA;    href=&quot;./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/pattern_10BE6D96.html&quot;&#xD;&#xA;    guid=&quot;_0YJvUMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw&quot;>Pattern&lt;/a>s and seeking opportunities to leverage patterns are useful techniques. The&#xD;&#xA;    value of patterns here is that they provide a shortcut to a robust design. For instance, when there's an interface&#xD;&#xA;    realized by multiple classes, it's possible that an Abstract Factory pattern will be useful, because the pattern&#xD;&#xA;    encapsulates the logic of what class should be instantiated. The more experienced a developer is, the better the&#xD;&#xA;    developer is at identifying opportunities to take advantage of, or leverage, patterns.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    The longer you use patterns, the easier it will be to identify opportunities to leverage them. At first, look for&#xD;&#xA;    places where you can clearly specify the need for some behavior. Perhaps there's a place where some function or&#xD;&#xA;    algorithm must be shared between many different classes. How can this behavior be shared over and over among&#xD;&#xA;    heterogeneous classes? Or perhaps a third-party library is replacing a block of custom code. Is there a way to make&#xD;&#xA;    this transition easier by creating an interface that can use either implementation? These are opportunities for finding&#xD;&#xA;    or possibly creating a pattern.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    See also &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot;&#xD;&#xA;    href=&quot;./../../../core.tech.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.tech_6CCF393.html#GAM95&quot;&#xD;&#xA;    guid=&quot;_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg&quot;>[GAM95]&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;and &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot;&#xD;&#xA;    href=&quot;./../../../core.tech.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.tech_6CCF393.html#SHA05&quot;&#xD;&#xA;    guid=&quot;_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg&quot;>[SHA05]&lt;/a>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;h3>&#xD;&#xA;    Inheriting behavior versus inheriting interfaces&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h3>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    Inheritance (or generalization) is often used as a shortcut during implementation to quickly re-use behavior (code).&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;b>Caution:&lt;/b>&lt;br />&#xD;&#xA;    Work hard to remove behavior inheritance in design. It will almost always cost more effort than it saves.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    Inheritance is a very rigid structure with strict rules. A class that inherits from another class is establishing an&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;b>is-a&lt;/b> relationship. The inheriting class is a type of the parent class-- the child has the same relationships and&#xD;&#xA;    behaviors as the parent. In most hierarchies, it will be impossible to maintain this type of relationship. Exceptions&#xD;&#xA;    quickly creep in, and it's common to find child classes that remove or override behavior in the parent classes. This&#xD;&#xA;    increases maintenance costs and makes it difficult to understand what each class does.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    It's also too tempting to instantiate parent classes, which makes the parent class both abstract and concrete. If a&#xD;&#xA;    class has children, it must be abstract enough to support the generalized behavior of the children. But if it's&#xD;&#xA;    instantiated, it must be concrete enough to provide specific behavior. It's rarely possible to fulfill both of these&#xD;&#xA;    competing imperatives at the same time, and the design suffers.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    Use association and aggregation relationships instead of inheriting behavior. Patterns are a good tool to leverage in&#xD;&#xA;    breaking up inheritance hierarchies.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    Inheriting interfaces is safe, because only the description and not the implementation of what needs to be done is&#xD;&#xA;    reused.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    Avoiding inheriting behavior is an application of the Open-Closed Principle. See &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;&#xA;    href=&quot;./../../../practice.tech.evolutionary_design.base/guidances/concepts/design_E36137FA.html&quot;&#xD;&#xA;    guid=&quot;_bFjlAPTYEduDKIuqTXQ8SA&quot;>Concept: Design&lt;/a> for more information.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;h3>&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;strong>Revisit the analysis&lt;/strong>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h3>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    The &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;&#xA;    href=&quot;./../../../practice.tech.evolutionary_design.base/guidances/guidelines/analyze_the_design_4C4750C0.html&quot;&#xD;&#xA;    guid=&quot;__MnggPTdEduDKIuqTXQ8SA&quot;>Guideline: Analyze the Design&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;describes techniques that are also useful when&#xD;&#xA;    evolving a more robust design.&lt;br />&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;h4>&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;strong>Consider the architecture&lt;/strong>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h4>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    The architecture must be considered in all design changes. The &quot;best&quot; design for a particular part of the solution may&#xD;&#xA;    not be appropriate because of architectural constraints that must support the entire system. The architecture may also&#xD;&#xA;    help to make design decisions, because it can be part of the selection criteria between two potential solutions.&#xD;&#xA;    Developers should always be up-to-date with the architecture and review it often, particularly in early iterations.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    This guideline remarks on conforming to the architecture in various ways; it is written as though it is about designing&#xD;&#xA;    within a pre-existing architecture. Although projects will often have pre-existing architectures available, a&#xD;&#xA;    particular architecture is the result of design activities. Therefore, in addition to discussing conformance to some&#xD;&#xA;    existing architecture, you must also consider the creation of the architecture, as well as updates and improvements&#xD;&#xA;    based on the work of design.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    Also, see&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot;&#xD;&#xA;    href=&quot;./../../../core.tech.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.tech_6CCF393.html#SHA05&quot;&#xD;&#xA;    guid=&quot;_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg&quot;>[SHA05]&lt;/a> for a&amp;nbsp;useful introduction to object-oriented techniques that should be&#xD;&#xA;    applied when evolving a good design.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>" longPresentationName=",_C4U9QPTeEduDKIuqTXQ8SA"/>
