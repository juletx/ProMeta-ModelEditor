It aims at&#xD;&#xA;    creating the right level of granularity for each purpose, so that the investment in planning is held to a minimum.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    Begin by understanding the high-level features that the system is expected to possess. These are the system's main&#xD;&#xA;    themes or services, and they are typically described or listed in a vision document. They serve to set goals and&#xD;&#xA;    expectations, both internally and externally, and they guide and constrain the iteration planning.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    The project plan is coarser-grained than iteration plans. As &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot;&#xD;&#xA;    href=&quot;./../../../core.mgmt.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.mgmt_D80619F3.html#LEF07&quot;&#xD;&#xA;    guid=&quot;_JlTPUM6aEdyuBO4ZIzcyig&quot;>[LEF07]&lt;/a> notes, a system can be described with a list of 25-50 features, calibrated&#xD;&#xA;    to the relative complexity of that system. Iteration plans, on the other hand, are described in terms of individual&#xD;&#xA;    user stories, use cases and scenarios, or other work items that will be&amp;nbsp;developed in each iteration.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    As early in the project as possible, ideally as part of the kick-off of a new project, hold a planning session (with&#xD;&#xA;    the whole team and the stakeholders of the system) during which the initial project plan is established.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    Update the project plan as often as necessary to reflect changing business priorities and needs.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    Iteration plans help to estimate and track individual iterations. For each iteration, its plan is created just-in-time,&#xD;&#xA;    based on the currently highest prioritized work items in the product backlog.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;h3>&#xD;&#xA;    Common pitfalls&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h3>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    One of the biggest challenges with agile planning is to resist pressure from upper management if they require to see&#xD;&#xA;    complete plans up-front in the project. This is best avoided by involving them in the planning process, and by&#xD;&#xA;    demonstrating the value of empirical planning by making the process transparent and open (to the organization and the&#xD;&#xA;    project's stakeholders) so that they can easily follow the progress of the project.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    It can be difficult to find the right level of granularity for the features of a given system. With too many features,&#xD;&#xA;    the planning process becomes tedious and error-prone, and will work counter to the intent.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>" longPresentationName="how_to_adopt,_ERIDQOMPEdyM47cGD2jiaQ"/>
