How the project team&#xD;&#xA;    is staffed, by either adding or removing people, will greatly impact the team's productivity.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    When staffing a development project, consider the following advice:&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul>&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li>&#xD;&#xA;        Include people who fit into the existing team culture. Good teams do not just appear magically one day, but instead&#xD;&#xA;        are grown and nurtured over time. Invite people onto the team who will add value and, furthermore, who will not be&#xD;&#xA;        disruptive. Similarly, you may need to invite someone to leave the team if they do not fit well with the existing&#xD;&#xA;        team and they do not seem to be able to change.&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/li>&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li>&#xD;&#xA;        People should want to be on the team. People are far more productive when they are working on a project that they&#xD;&#xA;        believe in and want to see succeed.&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/li>&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li>&#xD;&#xA;        Build your team with &quot;generalizing specialists&quot;. A generalizing specialist is someone with one or more technical&#xD;&#xA;        specialties who actively seeks to gain new skills in their existing specialties as well as in other areas,&#xD;&#xA;        including both technical and domain areas. Generalizing specialists add value to the team because they have&#xD;&#xA;        specialized skills that you need, while at the same time appreciate the full range of issues that a general&#xD;&#xA;        understanding of the software development process and the business domain offers.&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/li>&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li>&#xD;&#xA;        Include stakeholders. stakeholders, including business stakeholders (such as end users) and technical stakeholders&#xD;&#xA;        (such as operations staff), can add significant value to your team. Instead of just interviewing them to gain&#xD;&#xA;        information from them, or asking them to review your work, why not include them as active participants on the team?&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/li>&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li>&#xD;&#xA;        Include specialists for short-term, specialized work. Specialists can still add value on an agile development team,&#xD;&#xA;        particularly when they have specific skills and experience that existing team members do not have. It can often be&#xD;&#xA;        very effective to bring a specialist into the team for a short period of time to help with a specific task (such as&#xD;&#xA;        installation and setup of an application server, the development of an architectural spike, or simply taking part&#xD;&#xA;        in a review).&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/li>&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li>&#xD;&#xA;        Assess available knowledge and skills. Give people opportunities to evolve their skills. At the beginning of a&#xD;&#xA;        project, the team may not have the full range of skills that it needs, or perhaps a few individuals may not have&#xD;&#xA;        the skills required to fulfill the roles they are filling. This is a very common risk taken by the majority of&#xD;&#xA;        project teams for the simple reasons that you often cannot find the perfect combination of people and, even if you&#xD;&#xA;        could, you still want to provide people with opportunities to grow as professionals. Determine skills improvement&#xD;&#xA;        objectives and set up a plan to achieve them. Perform an assessment at major project milestones to track progress&#xD;&#xA;        against objectives.&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/li>&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li>&#xD;&#xA;        Remember Brook's Law. Adding people to a late project will only make it later [&lt;a&#xD;&#xA;        href=&quot;./../../../core.mgmt.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.mgmt_D80619F3.html#BRO95&quot;&#xD;&#xA;        guid=&quot;_JlTPUM6aEdyuBO4ZIzcyig&quot;>BRO95&lt;/a>]. The corollary is that removing people from a late project may speed&#xD;&#xA;        things up [&lt;a href=&quot;./../../../core.tech.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.tech_6CCF393.html&quot;&#xD;&#xA;        guid=&quot;_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg&quot;>AMB04&lt;/a>].&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/li>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    Sometimes you will need to go against some of this advice due to environmental constraints. Perhaps only specialists&#xD;&#xA;    are available (although there is nothing stopping a specialist from becoming a generalizing specialist), perhaps there&#xD;&#xA;    are not as many opportunities for people to try new things as they would like, or perhaps the stakeholders are not&#xD;&#xA;    available to be active members of the team. The advice above is designed to lead to as high-performing a team as&#xD;&#xA;    possible, but even partial adherence to this guideline will improve the team.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>" longPresentationName="new_guideline,_Jq64EJjsEduad8I_c-ogIA"/>
