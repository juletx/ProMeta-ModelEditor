    With collective code ownership, any member of the team can change any piece of code in the system at any time. There&#xD;
    should not be a policy or norm that one person is responsible for one part of the code base so that others are not&#xD;
    allowed to modify it.&#xD;
&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&#xD;
    Fostering an environment where any developer might be expected to modify any piece of code to implement some&#xD;
    functionality, fix a bug, or improve the solution leads to a more collaborative team experience. Developers will become&#xD;
    familiar with more of the code and benefit from the experience of others. It drives a high-performance team and removes&#xD;
    hurdles so that changes can be made by those who need them when they need them. No one person can become the gatekeeper&#xD;
    or bottleneck for changes to some subsystem within the code base.&#xD;
&lt;/p&gt;&#xD;
&lt;p&gt;&#xD;
    Collective code ownership works best if there are coding standards to prevent one developer's style from being&#xD;
    significantly different than another's (see &lt;a class="elementLinkWithType"&#xD;
    href="./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/coding_standard_1FF691E0.html"&#xD;
    guid="_aGqAsJ01EdyQ3oTO93enUw"&gt;Concept: Coding Standard&lt;/a&gt;). It is also critical that there are developer tests in&#xD;
    place to ensure that work on a unit of code does not break it.&#xD;
