Removed &quot;Identify constraints on the system&quot;||Need to determine how to make this work with GS method's practices for these removed steps.|Some options:|- OpenUP could be doing something simpler than the GS Method approach that is ok to do as well (need to convince GBS)|- OpenUP could have a practice for doing these additional things that isn't part of the &quot;basic vision&quot;, but can be added in by contributing steps|- OpenUP could go with a more basic practice for defining a vision, and not do these aspects|- The steps could be written as &quot;optional things to do if you don't have a separate practice&quot;.||I like the first option best.||2. Removed &quot;Update the vision&quot; which occurs throughout the task.||3. Removed all the links to work items - we shoudn't assume it is there.||4. Removed hyperlinks to attached guidance.
