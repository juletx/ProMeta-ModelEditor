This ensures that stakeholders and the development team have a common understanding of the problem to be&#xD;&#xA;    solved, and understand the stakeholders' needs.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    Begin by reviewing the reference material associated with this practice to better understand the intent of the&#xD;&#xA;    practice. Review the template for the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;&#xA;    href=&quot;./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/workproducts/vision_2E71B03C.html&quot;&#xD;&#xA;    guid=&quot;_0WVxcMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw&quot;>Vision&lt;/a> to understand the information that it captures. Tailor the template for the&#xD;&#xA;    specific needs of the project. Review the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;&#xA;    href=&quot;./../../../practice.tech.shared_vision.base/tasks/develop_technical_vision_9D36CF2F.html&quot;&#xD;&#xA;    guid=&quot;_0fOAoMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw&quot;>Develop Technical Vision&lt;/a> task to understand what needs to be performed to capture&#xD;&#xA;    and communicate the vision. Review the guidelines on requirements gathering techniques and requirements reviews&#xD;&#xA;    associated with the Develop Technical Vision task, and select the appropriate technique(s) for the project. Educate the&#xD;&#xA;    development team and relevant stakeholders on the purpose of this practice, and get buy-in on the techniques that will&#xD;&#xA;    be used to establish and maintain a shared vision.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    This practice is related to many other useful practices. For example:&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul>&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li>&#xD;&#xA;        Requirements practices: the vision is one of the outcomes of stakeholder requests elicitation. It is also the&#xD;&#xA;        primary input for developing more fine-grained technical requirements. stakeholders and the development team use&#xD;&#xA;        the vision to provide the context and high-level objectives for the detailed technical requirements.&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/li>&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li>&#xD;&#xA;        Architecture practices: the vision outlines the high-level objectives and constraints for the system that inform&#xD;&#xA;        architectural design decisions.&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/li>&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li>&#xD;&#xA;        Project management practices: the vision defines the scope and constraints of the project that are the basis for&#xD;&#xA;        work prioritization and initial estimates of effort. The value delivered by the team at each milestone must align&#xD;&#xA;        with stakeholders' expectations, expressed by the project vision.&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/li>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;h3>&#xD;&#xA;    Common pitfalls&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/h3>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;b>Rushing into a solution before the problem is understood.&lt;/b> The result is typically a system that fails to solve&#xD;&#xA;    stakeholder problems and satisfy stakeholder needs. Avoid design while capturing the vision. Focus on the &quot;what&quot; and&#xD;&#xA;    &quot;why&quot; of the product, rather than detailing the solution. Detailed technical requirements will be developed later, in&#xD;&#xA;    conjunction with architectural design and trade-off analysis.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;b>Failure to gain agreement on the problem to be solved.&lt;/b> Make sure that you have identified all stakeholders,&#xD;&#xA;    captured their needs and wishes, and obtained agreement on the problem to be solved and associated constraints. Missing&#xD;&#xA;    a critical stakeholder can result in significant re-work later.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;b>Failure to manage scope.&lt;/b> Rome was not built in a day (or in a single project). Make sure that you capture&#xD;&#xA;    stakeholder needs and features, and prioritize them to deliver as much value as early as possible. If the estimated&#xD;&#xA;    effort is too great to commit to for a single external release, divide and conquer. The product vision may span more&#xD;&#xA;    than one release of the product, providing a roadmap for future work, as well as work planned for the current project.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>" longPresentationName="how_to_adopt,_TcmHIDzQEd2XwI9llpWEBA"/>
