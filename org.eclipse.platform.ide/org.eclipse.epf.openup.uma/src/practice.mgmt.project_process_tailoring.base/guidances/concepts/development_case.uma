It provides a mechanism for&#xA;    describing how a project has tailored a process for their specific project.&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xA;&lt;p>&#xA;    In general, the development case typically refers to a standard process, often defined at an organization level, and&#xA;    then describes how that process has been tailored or specialized for the project.&amp;nbsp; This typically includes:&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xA;&lt;ul>&#xA;    &lt;li>&#xA;        Information about how the process varies from the standard process, and why (typically by identifying work products&#xA;        added or removed from the process)&#xA;    &lt;/li>&#xA;    &lt;li>&#xA;        What work products are reviewed at which milestones, and their level of completion&#xA;    &lt;/li>&#xA;    &lt;li>&#xA;        References to guidelines and information that the project wants to use in addition to the information contained in&#xA;        the main process.&#xA;    &lt;/li>&#xA;    &lt;li>&#xA;        What reviews will be performed, and their level of formality.&#xA;    &lt;/li>&#xA;    &lt;li>&#xA;        What approvals are required, by whom, and when.&#xA;    &lt;/li>&#xA;&lt;/ul>&#xA;&lt;p>&#xA;    The development case also includes information on what was tailored and why.&#xA;&lt;/p>" longPresentationName="development_case,_NOBsuyZLEd-QuZFPf_YdqQ"/>
