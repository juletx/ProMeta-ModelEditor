Because neither of these areas&#xD;&#xA;    are strengths of the software development community, two new roles have been introduced that take advantage of the&#xD;&#xA;    experience and expertise of niche support staff often found in or around an IT organization.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    By playing to the strengths and availability of Technical Writers, Course Developers,&amp;nbsp;and Trainers, a Development&#xD;&#xA;    Team does not need to worry about who will write the user documents and train end users - in this case, they can have&#xD;&#xA;    the specialists accept those responsibilities. Also, working with these two specialists ultimately will improve the&#xD;&#xA;    development team's ability to articulate details of the system that they are building and provide insight into subtle&#xD;&#xA;    ways to better comment and document their code.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    Virtually all applications that are developed will be used or supported by people. Very often, however, both the&#xD;&#xA;    documentation and training aspects of systems implementation are overlooked or not given enough emphasis. Inattention&#xD;&#xA;    to these areas can result in a product that does not achieve its full business value because the people who should&#xD;&#xA;    benefit from the application are not fully informed or trained.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    Although this practice is documented and adopted at the development team level, in some organizations it may be&#xD;&#xA;    advantageous to consolidate and integrate all types of documentation and training materials at the program level and&#xD;&#xA;    deliver one comprehensive package to stakeholders, end users, and IT operations support personnel for the entire&#xD;&#xA;    release across the program.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>" longPresentationName="new_practice,_05YDQGq6EeCHjvXUbVfnOw" problem="&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    The purpose of this practice is to harden the product before a release by documenting key aspects for use by multiple&#xD;&#xA;    audiences and by providing training to end users who will take delivery of the product when it is released.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>" application="&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    With this practice, basic guidance regarding &lt;em>how&lt;/em> to develop documentation and training, and more importantly&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;em>why&lt;/em>, are provided here. The best way to read this practice is to become familiar with its overall structure,&#xD;&#xA;    what is in it, and how it is organized.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    There are two related parts to this practice: 1) Documentation, and 2) Training. The documentation activity normally&#xD;&#xA;    feeds the training effort. There are three basic types of documentation, each of which is meant for a different&#xD;&#xA;    audience, and each has its own purpose.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;ul>&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li>&#xD;&#xA;        Product&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/li>&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li>&#xD;&#xA;        User&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/li>&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;li>&#xD;&#xA;        Support&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;/li>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/ul>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    A combination of the Product Documentation and User Documentation, with User Stories and Nonfunctional Requirements,&#xD;&#xA;    are used in the development of User Training.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    Product Documentation, with the Architecture Notebook and any design artifacts, are used to create Support&#xD;&#xA;    Documentation.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    Start with the tasks for creating the different types of documentation. Then, review the work products that result from&#xD;&#xA;    those tasks. Next, review the tasks of the training activity. Notice that there is only one task that produces two&#xD;&#xA;    different types of training materials (end user and support materials), because the process is the same for both&#xD;&#xA;    (unlike the process for developing the three types of documentation). There are two tasks for training delivery because&#xD;&#xA;    the end user training often is formal in nature and support training usually is informal.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>"/>
