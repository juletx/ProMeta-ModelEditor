However,&#xD;&#xA;    after a product is delivered, customers who pay for the system and for support often do not have enough information to&#xD;&#xA;    effectively manage the product.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    If a technical writer is made available to a development team, that role often takes the burden off the team for&#xD;&#xA;    developing the formal product documentation and for ensuring that it is in the correct format and business language. If&#xD;&#xA;    a technical writer is not available, the development team and product owner must make every effort to create enough&#xD;&#xA;    documentation to ensure that the features that have been developed for each release are understood and can be&#xD;&#xA;    communicated effectively by the paying customer to their stakeholders.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>&#xD;&#xA;&lt;p>&#xD;&#xA;    Delivering a professionally developed product requires that a development team provide the customer with accurate,&#xD;&#xA;    detailed, and comprehensive product documentation.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/p>" longPresentationName="01_create_update_product_documenation,_t15g4DHMEeC7j_IRiP-WPQ" purpose="The purpose of this task is to document enough information about the features that were developed in a particular release&#xD;&#xA;to be useful to customers throughout the life of the product.">
