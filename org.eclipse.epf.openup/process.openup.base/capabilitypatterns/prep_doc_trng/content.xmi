    Development team members sometimes take documentation for granted, or do not give it enough consideration. However,&#xD;
    after a product is delivered, Customers who pay for the system and for support often do not have enough information to&#xD;
    effectively manage the product.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If a Technical Writer is made available to a development team, that role often takes the burden off the team for&#xD;
    developing the formal product documentation and for ensuring that it is in the correct format and business language. If&#xD;
    a Technical Writer is not available, the development team and Product Owner must make every effort to create enough&#xD;
    documentation to ensure that the features that have been developed for each Release are understood and can be&#xD;
    communicated effectively by the paying Customer to their stakeholders.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Delivering a professionally developed product requires that a development team provide the Customer with accurate,&#xD;
    detailed, and comprehensive product documentation.&#xD;

    User documentation might include all or parts of user manuals (electronic or paper-based), tutorials, frequently asked&#xD;
    questions (FAQs), on-line Help Files, installation instructions, operational procedures, etc. User documentation often&#xD;
    is used as the basis for training materials - if the documentation is of poor quality, the training materials might not&#xD;
    be any better.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Without good user documentation, a system might be well developed by a development team but might not meet the End User's&#xD;
    expectations because they will not be able operate the application effectively.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Support documentation often is the most overlooked aspect of a documentation effort. Anyone who has had the opportunity&#xD;
    to provide End User support for a particular application can appreciate how important effective, well-written support&#xD;
    documentation can be. This documentation very often is technical in nature and differs significantly from user or&#xD;
    product documentation, which normally is written for the lay person.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The development team should do its best to make sure that personnel who perform an IT support role have the right amount and&#xD;
    the relevant type of information necessary to support the application, whether they provide Tier 1, Tier 2, or Tier 3&#xD;
    support. Support documentation often is developed based on these three different support categories. How&#xD;
    effectively the code base is commented and the ease with which those comments are found and understood contributes to&#xD;
    the quality and quantity of support documentation.&#xD;
&lt;/p></refinedDescription>

    Product documentation is created for the benefit of the marketing arm of an organization, the Program Manager, and&#xD;
    those people who must assess the business value of a particular system.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This is an often overlooked aspect of development team implementation. The team should consider that the customers of a&#xD;
    particular Release usually are not technical themselves, but do require a detailed enough understanding of how their&#xD;
    product operates and how it meets stated business goals and needs.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Support documentation usually is developed for the three common tiers of a support organization. Tier 1 typically is&#xD;
    the Help Desk where users call when they have a problem with a particular system. Tier 1 support personnel&#xD;
    normally answer basic questions and, if necessary, log a ticket and escalate it to the appropriate Level 2 support&#xD;
    desk.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Tier 2 support personnel may deal with more complex questions or issues regarding an application and might need to&#xD;
    do some research on the characteristics of the system to provide an answer. If that person cannot resolve the&#xD;
    issue, the ticket is escalated to Tier 3 support personnel who have a deeper understanding of the application's&#xD;
    code and the technology support the system's architecture.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    To properly convey the necessary information to each support tier, the application's code base should be well commented&#xD;
    and logically organized. This approach will facilitate the development of the support documentation.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Support documentation typically includes:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        User manuals with work instructions, process descriptions, and procedures&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Communications, training, and knowledge transfer deliverables&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Support and operations manuals&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Service information, including Help Desk scripts&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Having the correct amount and type of materials available to adequately train End Users and supporters of an&#xD;
    application is necessary to promote usability and to achieve the desired business value. If a Course Developer is&#xD;
    available, they can assume most of the burden of creating the training materials, lab exercises, and workshops&amp;nbsp;for&#xD;
    delivery of&amp;nbsp;those courses to either End Users or support personnel. If a Course Developer is not&#xD;
    available,&amp;nbsp;Development team members should take the time to properly develop a suite of training materials for the&#xD;
    feature set developed during a Release.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Although different parts of training materials should be created during Feature Development Sprint/Iterations, the bulk of the&#xD;
    work (and the integration of the materials) usually is reserved for the Release Sprint/Iteration that occurs immediately before a&#xD;
    scheduled Release.&#xD;
