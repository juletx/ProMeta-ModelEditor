    The purpose of this discipline is to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Understand the problem to be solved
    </li>
    <li>
        Understand stakeholder needs (what users want)
    </li>
    <li>
        Define the requirements for the solution (what the system must do)
    </li>
    <li>
        Define the boundaries (scope) of the system

</ul>
<p>
    To achieve these goals, it is important to understand the definition and scope of the problem that you are trying to
    solve. Identify stakeholders and define the problem to be solved. Having agreed on the problem to be solved, the
    requirements for the system are elicited, organized, analyzed, validated, and specified.

    Throughout the lifecycle, you manage changes to the requirements.The Requirements discipline is related to the other

    The purpose of this discipline is to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Provide early and frequent <em>feedback</em> about whether the system satisfies the requirements
    </li>
    <li>
        Objectively measure progress in small increments
    </li>
    <li>
        Identify issues with the solution, increasing the probability that the system will behave correctly
    </li>
    <li>
        Provide assurance that changes to the system do not introduce new defects
    </li>
    <li>
        Improve velocity by facilitating the discovery of issues with requirements, designs, and implementations as early
        as possible
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The Test discipline is iterative and incremental. It applies the strategy of "test early and test often" to retire
    risks as early as possible in the system's lifecycle.
</p>
<p>
    Testing occurs in each iteration of the lifecycle, beginning with the earliest builds of the system. In fact, it is
    common for one iteration to have many test cycles, depending on the frequency of new builds.
</p>
<p>
    Testing asks the question: "What does the solution have to <em>do</em> for us to consider a requirement implemented?"
    Tests elaborate on the requirements with specific conditions of satisfaction that the solution must meet.
</p>
<p>
    This discipline challenges the assumptions, risks, and uncertainty inherent in the development of highly technical
    artifacts and addresses those concerns by using concrete demonstration and impartial evaluation.
</p>
<p>
    The Test discipline relates to the other disciplines in the following ways:

</p>
<p>
    New practice "Project Process Tailoring", in order to provide basic coverage for the Environment discipline.
</p>
<p>
    New&nbsp;practice "Method Development". This practice replaces the "Method Authoring Method" (MAM).&nbsp; The new

<h4>
    1.5&nbsp;
</h4>
<p>
    This is the initial release of the practices library, which is included as part of the Eclipse Process Framework (EPF)
    1.5.
</p>
<p>
    Most of the open source content derives from OpenUP 1.0, refactored to support independent practices.
</p>
<p>
    These are the key new features in the core:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Work product slots to allow practices to be independent of each other.
    </li>
    <li>
        Default navigation view that <i>ad hoc</i> configurations of practices can be published easily with a view.
    </li>
    <li>
        Guidance and work products&nbsp;reusable across practices have been moved into common plug-ins.
    </li>
    <li>
        Category, role, and tool definitions separated into separate plug-ins to allow them to be easily removed and
        replaced&nbsp;by alternative categorizations.
    </li>
</ul>]]></MainDescription>

    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        One (or more) team members performs both this role and tests the software. This is a good option for smaller test&#xD;
        teams or resource&lt;font color=&quot;#ff0000&quot;>-&lt;/font>constrained test teams.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A customer representative performs this role. This approach is suitable to agile teams where the customer is&#xD;
        available and is part of the team.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></AssignmentApproaches>

          <MainDescription><![CDATA[<p>
    The person in this role leads or coordinates the technical design of the system and has overall responsibility for
    facilitating the major technical decisions expressed as software architecture. This typically includes identifying and
    documenting the architecturally significant aspects of the system as views that describe requirements, design,
    implementation, and deployment.
</p>
<p>
    This role is also responsible for providing the rationale for these decisions, balancing the concerns of the various
    stakeholders, reducing technical risks, and ensuring that decisions are effectively communicated, validated, and
    followed.
</p>
<p>
    This role works closely with project managers in staffing and planning the project, because it is recommended
    that the team be organized around the architecture.
</p>
<p>
    This role also works closely with analysts and developers to make sure that the architecturally significant
    requirements are assigned to the proper components of the system.

          <KeyConsiderations></KeyConsiderations>
          <AssignmentApproaches>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The person in this role should be engaged in the project from start to finish.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For smaller projects, a single person can act as both Architect and project manager. However, it is better to have&#xD;
    these roles performed by different people to ensure that the pressures of one role does not cause neglect of the other&#xD;
    role. The Architect and Project Manager must work together closely.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For systems of scale, it is a common best practice to have an architecture board that is populated by the architects of&#xD;
    each system, plus one or two chief architects.  In such cases, the members of the architecture board collectively&#xD;
    play the role of the Architect.&#xD;
&lt;/p></AssignmentApproaches>
          <Skills>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Architects must be well-rounded people with maturity, vision, and a depth of experience that allows for grasping issues&#xD;
    quickly and making educated, critical judgments in the absence of complete information. Specifically, the person must&#xD;
    possess this combination of qualifications:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Experience&lt;/b> &lt;strong>in both problem and software engineering domains&lt;/strong>, with evidence of a thorough&#xD;
        understanding of the requirements to solve the problem and active participation in software development. If there&#xD;
        is a team, this experience can be represented by different team members, but at least one person must be able to&#xD;
        describe the overall vision for the project.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Leadership ability&lt;/b> to motivate and maintain momentum for the technical effort across the various teams and&#xD;
        to make critical decisions under pressure, plus make those decisions stick. To be effective, this role must have&#xD;
        the authority to make technical decisions. This role cannot lead by decree, but only by the consent of the rest of&#xD;
        the project team. To be effective, this person must earn the respect of the team members, project managers,&#xD;
        the customer, and the user community, as well as the management team.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Excellent communication&lt;/b> &lt;strong>skills&lt;/strong> to earn trust, persuade, motivate, and mentor. The person in&#xD;
        this role must have good communication skills, both verbally and in writing.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Critical review skills&lt;/b> to make sure that the requirements to be built are clear and consistent and to make&#xD;
        sure that the developed system adheres to the architecture. &#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Goal-oriented and proactive&lt;/b> &lt;strong>orientation&lt;/strong> &lt;b>with a relentless focus on&#xD;
        results. &lt;/b>This person is the technical driving force behind the project, not a visionary or dreamer. The&#xD;
        career of a successful architect is a long series of sub-optimal decisions made in uncertainty and under pressure.&#xD;
        Only those who can focus on doing what needs to be done will be successful.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    From an expertise standpoint, the Architect also needs to show both design and implementation abilities. However, from&#xD;
    the design perspective, the effective Architect typically exhibits these traits:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Tends to be a generalist, rather than a specialist, who knows many technologies at a high level rather than a few&#xD;
        technologies at the detailed level&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Makes the broader technical decisions, thereby demonstrating broad knowledge and experience, as well as&#xD;
        communication and leadership skills&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

    This role is the one and only person responsible for managing the Product Backlog and ensuring the value of the work
    the development team performs. The Product Owner has the responsibility of defining what is the right product to build,
    determining the order in which features will be built, and making sure that the product actually works. The Product
    Owner is responsible for defining the features of the product to be developed by the team in terms of:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Functionality:</strong> Identifies each product requirement as a Product Backlog Item and supplies
        details for those requirements when they are needed by the team, including specifying the acceptance tests for
        each requirement
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Priority:</strong> Defines the order in which those backlog items will be developed, according to the value
        that they bring to Customers and users, which provides the team with a Product Backlog ready for Sprint/Iteration
        planning
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Goal:</strong> Defines the release goals and makes decisions concerning release planning
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The Product Owner has the following responsibilities:
</p>
<ul class="noindent">
    <li>
        Define the features of the product
    </li>
    <li>
        Decide on release date and content
    </li>
    <li>
        Responsible for the profitability of the product (ROI)
    </li>
    <li>
        Prioritize features according to market value
    </li>
    <li>
        Adjust features and priorities as needed
    </li>
    <li>
        Accept or reject work results
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    This person maintains the Product Backlog and ensures that it is visible to everyone. Everyone understands what items
    have the highest priority, so everyone on the development Team knows what will be worked on.
</p>
<p>
    The Product Owner is one person, not a committee. Committees may exist that advise or influence this person but team
    members who want to change an item's priority must first convince the Product Owner. In this way, organizational
    methods for setting priorities and requirements are influenced over time by this role.
</p>
<p>
    For the Product Owner to succeed, everyone in the organization must respect their decisions. No one is allowed to
    direct the development team member to work from a different set of priorities. Team members are not allowed to follow the direction
    of anyone whose direction does not coincide with the direction provided by the Product Owner. The Product Owner’s
    decisions are visible in the content and prioritization of the Product Backlog. This visibility requires that the
    Product Owner do their best. Visibility makes the role of Product Owner both a demanding and a rewarding experience.
</p>
<p>
    The Product Owner is responsible for the first of the three Scrum ceremonies, Sprint/Iteration Planning. The development team evaluates
    the prioritized Product Backlog, identifies the top priority items, and commits to completing the selected items during
    a Sprint/Iteration. These items become the basis for the Sprint/Iteration Backlog.
</p>
<p>
    In return for the development team's commitment to completing the selected tasks, the Product Owner commits that they will
    not introduce new requirements to the team during the Sprint/Iteration. Requirements are allowed to change but only outside the
    Sprint/Iteration. After the team begins a Sprint/Iteration, it remains focused on the goals of that Sprint/Iteration. The only exception to this
    rule is that a similar amount of work can be removed from a Sprint/Iteration to accommodate a new requirement.

    Only one person can play this role for each development team. This person must be assigned to the project (the Product&#xD;
    Owner is a member of the development team and should participate in the Daily Stand-up meeting). The workload&#xD;
    associated with this role almost requires a full-time assignment.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Product Owner is:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A single person dedicated to the project who must be available to answer the team's questions promptly to define&#xD;
        feature tests and provide advice regarding various product aspects (the software UI, for example)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        An extended member of the team who participates in Sprint/Iteration planning and Sprint/Iteration review meetings&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Typically someone from a Marketing role or a key user in internal development&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Can be a Customer representative or a Customer proxy&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;

    Suggestions from&amp;nbsp;Ken Schwaber's&amp;nbsp;Scrum Guide:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The Product Owner can be a Team member, and in addition perform development work. This additional responsibility&#xD;
        may affect the Product Owner’s ability to work with stakeholders. However, the Product Owner can never be the&#xD;
        ScrumMaster.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        For commercial development, the Product Owner may be the product manager. For in-house development efforts, the&#xD;
        Product Owner can be the manager of the business function that is being automated.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></AssignmentApproaches>
            <Skills>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The person who plays this role should have the following competencies:&#xD;

    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Good knowledge of the business domain&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Demonstrate leadership and be respected by external stakeholders (Customers and users)&#xD;

    Method Composer is generic term that is used to apply to EPF Composer and its extensions, such as Rational (R) Method
    Composer.&nbsp; Method Composer has two purposes:
</p>
<p>
    1. To provide a knowledge base of intellectual capital.&nbsp; This knowledge base can be used for reference and
    education.&nbsp; It can be used to communicate best practices across an organization in a consistent form.
</p>
<p>
    2. To provide process engineering capabilities by supporting process engineers and project managers in selecting,
    tailoring, and rapidly assembling processes for different kinds of development projects. Method Composer provides
    catalogs of pre-defined processes for typical project situations that can be adapted to individual needs. It also
    provides process building blocks that represent best development practices for specific disciplines, technologies, or
    development styles. These building blocks form a toolkit for quickly assembling processes based on project specific
    needs. The resulting processes created with Method Composer can be published and deployed as Web sites.

    There are several use scenarios for <a class="elementLink"

    guid="__V7pAMaEEduMlb2cQZNTYw">method configuration</a>s produced by using EPF Composer or Rational Method Composer

    more&nbsp;suitable&nbsp;to your teams' needs, while keeping it consistent and understandable.
</p>This guidance page describes typical customization scenarios and&nbsp;then provides references to additional
information on how to customize methods. 
<h3>
    Customization scenarios
</h3>
<p>
    The following sections describe&nbsp;possible customization scenarios. For information on specific tool features,
    consult the Method Composer online Help. For&nbsp;additional information on customizing methods, see the Additional
    Resources section that follows here.
</p>
<h4>
    Use existing plug-ins and packages to build your own process
</h4>
<p>
    Some consider this the most straight-forward customization scenario. Based on the provided content, you can use Method
    Composer to pick and choose the packages with the content that you want to publish and make available to your team.
    Removing a method package removes all references to the content of that package from the published process. For
    example, you can simplify a process to have it contain a minimal subset of its content by removing packages that
    contain elements of work that you do not want to perform. You do this by creating a new method configuration (or
    copying an existing one) into your method library. You can select packages as appropriate without affecting the
    configuration provided.
</p>
<h4>
    Add&nbsp;method content&nbsp;that your team needs
</h4>
<p>
    Some teams may need to perform a different task that is not covered by the standard content. Maybe they need to perform
    an extra step in an existing task, or they may need to add a new guideline for a given technique that they are
    following. Eventually, they need a new template for a document (or they may need to add or remove sections in an
    existing template).
</p>
<p>
    In such situations, the recommended approach is to create a separate plug-in in your library.&nbsp;It is not a good
    practice&nbsp;to make changes in the provided plug-in (meaning any plug-in for which you do not have control), because
    new versions of these plug-ins, when deployed, can override the changes that you have made.
</p>
<p>
    Method Composer provides a series of mechanisms that allow you to indirectly modify the content in an existing plug-in
    by using <i>content variability</i>. In your plug-in, you can define an element that contributes, extends, or replaces
    an element in the existing plug-in. For example, in your plug-in, you can define a task that contributes a new step to
    an existing task. You can also define a new artifact that replaces an existing artifact, and this new artifact can have
    a different name, structure, and associated template, for example. Then all you need to do is make sure that the
    existing plug-in and your new plug-in are part of the configuration to be published. During publication, Method
    Composer will resolve the content variability that you defined by adding the new content into the existing content
    where appropriate, replacing existing content with the content you defined, and so on.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<h4>
    Define a different development lifecycle
</h4>
<p>
    Both method content and process are created independently from&nbsp;each other. For example, you create tasks in the
    method content (and define their&nbsp;inputs, outputs, and responsible roles), but you do not necessarily define the
    lifecycle of your process, meaning the sequence in which the various tasks will be performed. On the process side, you
    then define the lifecycle (such as phases, iterations, activities, and tasks), as well as the precedence among these
    elements.
</p>
<p>
    Some teams may find the method content appropriate without any further customization, but they may want to work by
    following a different software development lifecycle. For example, some teams may like the four development phases and
    iterations from the unified process, but some may want to develop iteratively, without being tied to a specific phase
    structure. Again, you can add, remove and replace elements in the work breakdown structure of an existing process by
    applying process variability.
</p>
<p>
    As an alternative to tailoring an existing process, you can write a completely new process that reuses activities from
    one or more existing processes. In cases where you cannot find any reusable material at all, you can also create a
    completely new process from scratch. In most cases, however, you will start developing your own process by assembling
    reusable building blocks from method content, as well as predefined process patterns&nbsp;called <a
    class="elementLinkWithUserText"
    href="./../../../core.default.uma_concept.base/guidances/termdefinitions/capability_pattern_F5DDC5F.html"
    guid="_2RUJACO4EdqaNq6Ptg8uyA">capability patterns</a>. The resulting assembled process is called a&nbsp;<a
    class="elementLinkWithUserText"
    href="./../../../core.default.uma_concept.base/guidances/termdefinitions/delivery_process_BCDF50B7.html"
    guid="_ZufeMCO3EdqaNq6Ptg8uyA">delivery process</a>. This newly created delivery process&nbsp;is part of a
    configuration that you publish and make available to members of your team.
</p>
<h4>
    Publish the process Web site
</h4>
<p>
    Every customization scenario is finalized by publishing content as HTML (on a Web site). Method Composer enables you to
    publish&nbsp;content based on a given configuration, which will publish all of the content available from
    the&nbsp;method and process packages selected in that configuration. Another option for publishing is to select only
    the capability patterns or delivery process of interest. This will make available only the content related to the
    process packages that you select.
</p>
<p>
    For the published Web site look and feel, you can customize the views and nodes in the directory (tree) browser by
    defining <a class="elementLinkWithUserText"
    href="./../../../core.default.uma_concept.base/guidances/termdefinitions/custom_category_554AC4D6.html"
    guid="_eqw94MaFEduMlb2cQZNTYw">custom categories</a> that will be part of your configuration.

          <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h3>
    Why Practices?
</h3>
<p>
    Practices enable a compositional approach to building methods. This approach offers the following benefits:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Adaptability and scalability
    </li>
    <li>
        Incremental adoption
    </li>
    <li>
        Easy to configure and use
    </li>
    <li>
        Community development
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Adaptability and Scalability
</h3>
<p>
    Practices can be adapted to&nbsp;support a range of solutions.&nbsp;In particular, practices can be adapted to suit
    your organization and supplemented by your own practices.
</p>
<p>
    The core practices are based on a common framework that allows them to be composed.&nbsp; These core practices&nbsp;are
    tool-agnostic, low-ceremony practices that can be extended to address a broad variety of development concerns, such as
    SOA, geographical distribution, model-driven architecture and embedded systems. Tool and technology specific guidance
    can be added, such as guidance on J2EE, and a variety of development tools. Some of these extensions can be quite
    modest, adding&nbsp;for example&nbsp;just tool specific guidance to existing tasks, while others can be comprehensive,
    defining processes that provide a radically expanded scope with new or altered artifacts, new or altered tasks, and new
    or altered roles.
</p>
<p>
    Extensions and additions to the practices can be the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        being used internally by an organization;
    </li>
    <li>
        open source as a part of the Eclipse Process Framework (EPF) project;
    </li>
    <li>
        made freely available outside the open source licenses of Eclipse (EPL);
    </li>
    <li>
        sold commercially as an extension to the basic framework, such as the IBM(R) Practices.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Incremental Adoption
</h3>
<p>
    Each practice is described as a standalone capability that can be adopted by an organization or project.&nbsp;Each
    practice may include enablement materials that explain how to get started.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<h3>
    Easy to Configure and Use
</h3>
<p>
    Creating a method is as simple as selecting the practices that you wish to adopt, and then publishing the
    results.&nbsp;Each practice adds itself into the framework so that content can be viewed by practice, or across
    practices by work product, role, task and so on.
</p>
<h3>
    Community Development
</h3>
<p>
    Since a practice can be easily authored on its own, practices are ideal for community development.&nbsp;The basic agile
    practices for the&nbsp;EPF Practices are, in fact, developed by the Eclipse Process Framework community.&nbsp;

    Opportunities in the EPF community
</h3>
<p>
    The Eclipse Process Framework (EPF) is an open source community that depends solely on the active participation of its
    user community to produce process content and tools. There are a variety of ways to participate in the development and
    deployment of EPF, depending on your interest and skill level.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        If all that you want to do is ask a few questions to get started, sign up for the <b>EPF Newsgroup</b> (more
        information follows).
    </li>
    <li>
        If you want to participate in discussions and decisions about the content and direction of EPF, sign up for the
        <b>epf-dev mailing list</b>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Use Bugzilla to get your hands dirty by reporting bugs and enhancements, verifying the correctness of method
        content, or submitting method content to address process issues.
    </li>
    <li>
        Participate at the highest levels by joining technical and committee meetings. These meetings are where detailed
        process issues and product strategy are discussed.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Everyone who downloads or uses EPF content is encouraged to participate at some level. EPF is only as good as the
    quality of the participation of its contributors.
</p>
<h4>
    EPF newsgroup
</h4>
<p>
    The EPF Newsgroup is the place to ask and answer questions about OpenUP, EPF Composer, and other EPF processes. Most of
    the traffic involves how to use EPF Composer, EPF Practices, and OpenUP. It's monitored by the community, and you can
    access it as you do any newsgroup. Everyone who uses EPF will benefit from the support it offers and by receiving
    announcements. Sign up for the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/epf/community/community_index.php"
    target="_blank">newsgroup now.</a>

    changes made by contributors must be attached to a Bugzilla entry.
</p>
<h4>
    Meetings and committees
</h4>
<p>
    There are numerous meetings every week to discuss progress and define solutions. The <a title="EPF Calendar"
    href="http://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=ajhou9i17tuj63nm6iu7qpnot8@group.calendar.google.com&amp;ctz=America/Los_Angeles"
     target="_blank">EPF Calendar</a> is open to everyone and lists all upcoming meetings (teleconferences and
    face-to-face). Participate in these meetings to dive deeply into issues by collaborating directly with other members of
    the community. Although everyone is welcome to attend these meetings, it's generally expected that participants will,
    at some point, take responsibility for some tasks.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    The calendar and the epf-dev newsgroup also announce the EPF committee meetings.&nbsp;This is the highest level of
    participation, where committers and contributors make critical decisions about EPF projects. Everyone from the
    community is welcome, and attendees are expected to participate in discussions and take on responsibility for
    addressing aspects of the EPF.

          <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h3>
    The Basic Elements
</h3>
<p>
    The basic elements of a process website are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Work product</strong>: what is produced
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Task</strong>: how to perform the work
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Role</strong>: who performs the work
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Process</strong>: used to define work breakdown and workflow
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Guidance</strong>: templates, checklists, examples, guidelines, concepts, and so on.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    These "basic elements" are the building blocks from which processes are composed.
</p>
<h3>
    Organizing Elements
</h3>
<p>
    The basic elements are organized using the following elements.
</p>
<h4>
    Practice
</h4>
<p>
    A practice is a documented approach to solving one or several commonly occurring problems. Practices are intended as
    "chunks" of process for adoption, enablement, and configuration. Practices are built from the basic elements described
    above.
</p>
<h4>
    Configuration
</h4>
<p>
    From the end-user perspective, a configuration is a selection of method content to be published.&nbsp; Most
    configurations consist of a selection of practices plus some&nbsp;content to tie the practices together. The published
    configuration is often loosely referred to as a process website.
</p>
<h3>
    Details and Examples
</h3>
<p>
    The following provides more detail about the basic elements and provides some examples.
</p>
<h4>
    Work product
</h4>
<p>
    Work products may take various shapes or forms, such as:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Documents, such as a Vision, or a Project Plan.
    </li>
    <li>
        A model, such as a Use-Case Model or a Design Model. These can contain model elements (sub-artifacts) such as
        Design Classes, Use Cases, and Design Subsystems.
    </li>
    <li>
        Databases, spreadsheets, and other information repositories.
    </li>
    <li>
        Source code and executables.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Work products can be classified as "artifacts" if they are concrete things, "outcomes" if they are not concrete, and
    "deliverables" if they are a packaging of artifacts.
</p>
<h4>
    Role
</h4>
<p>
    A role defines the behavior and responsibilities of an individual, or a set of individuals working together as a team,
    within the context of a software engineering organization.<br />
    Note that roles are not individuals; instead, roles describe responsibilities. An individual will typically take on
    several roles at one time, and frequently will change roles over the duration of the project.
</p>
<p>
    Some examples:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Analyst&nbsp;-</strong>&nbsp;Represents customers and end users, gathers input from stakeholders and
        defines requirements.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Developer -</strong> Develops a part of the system, including designing, implementing, unit testing, and
        integrating.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Task
</h4>
<p>
    A task is work performed by a role. It is usually defined as a series of steps that involve creating or updating one or
    more work products.
</p>
<p>
    Some examples:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Develop a vision -</strong> Develop an overall vision for the system, including capturing the problem to be
        solved, the key stakeholders, the scope and boundary of the system, the system's key features, and any constraints.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Plan Iteration -</strong> Define the scope and responsibilities of a single iteration.
    </li>
</ul><br />
<h4>
    Process
</h4>
<p>
    Processes pull together tasks, work products, and roles, and add structure and sequencing information.&nbsp; Tasks or
    work products can be grouped into higher level activities, called a work breakdown structure
    (WBS).&nbsp;&nbsp;Activities or tasks can be marked as "planned" to identify work that you expect to assign and track.
</p><br />
<br />
<center>

    src="core.default.uma_concept.base/guidances/concepts/resources/wbs_example.jpg" align="center" />&nbsp;<br />
    Figure 1: Example Work Breakdown
</center><br />
<br />
<p>
    Diagrams can be added to providing sequencing information.&nbsp; The following example shows an initial activity, "Plan
    Test Cycle", followed by two activities that go in parallel, "Monitor and Control Test" and "Test".
</p><br />
<br />
<center>
    <img height="453"

<br />
<p>
    Note that a&nbsp;reusable partial process is sometimes referred to as a capability pattern.
</p>
<h3>
    For More Information
</h3>
<p>
    More in-depth material on these concepts is generally found in articles on EPF Composer and Rational(R) Method
    Composer, which use these concepts as building blocks.

          <MainDescription><![CDATA[<p>
    This artifact&nbsp;helps you avoid miscommunication by providing two essential resources:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        A central location to look for terms and abbreviations that are new to development team members
    </li>
    <li>
        Definitions of terms that are used in specific ways within the domain
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Definitions for the glossary terms come from several sources, such as requirements documents, specifications, and
    discussions with stakeholders and domain experts.
</p>]]></MainDescription>
          <KeyConsiderations><![CDATA[<p>
    Although listed as an <i>output from</i> and an <i>input to</i> tasks associated with the requirements discipline, this
    artifact can be updated at any time and by any role as new terms are identified. The terms defined should be used
    according to the recorded definitions in all project documentation so that all stakeholders can clearly see that terms
    are being used consistently.
</p>
<p>
    One of the primary decisions when developing&nbsp;this artifact&nbsp;is whether to have all terms in a single glossary
    or to maintain terms in several glossaries, business terms artifacts, or models.&nbsp;If terms are defined in multiple
    places, you need to communicate all of those sources to the team and decide which take precedence.
</p>
<p>
    It may be important, even in small projects, to reference and use existing broader glossaries, business terms
    artifacts, or data models, where they exist.
</p>
<p>
    Industry- and organization-wide glossaries may be referenced, and compliance with such specific chosen standards may be
    required.
</p>]]></KeyConsiderations>
          <ImpactOfNotHaving>Misunderstandings about the meanings of data items account for many failed projects. Increased costs and delayed schedules&#xD;
are associated with projects that lack a common understanding of the terms being used.</ImpactOfNotHaving>
          <Purpose><![CDATA[<p>
    These are the purposes of&nbsp;this artifact:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        To record the terms that are being used on the project so that everyone has a common understanding of them
    </li>
    <li>
        To achieve consistency by promoting the use of common terminology across the project
    </li>
    <li>
        To make explicit different stakeholders' use of the same terms to mean different things or different terms to mean
        the same thing
    </li>
    <li>
        To provide important terms to the Analysis and Design team.
    </li>
</ul>]]></Purpose>
          <ReasonsForNotNeeding>&lt;p>&#xD;
    On small projects (for example,&amp;nbsp;enhancement projects), which rely on a team very familiar with the terms, this&#xD;
    artifact may be omitted.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If a project team has access to the glossary terms in some other form, this&amp;nbsp;artifact may be&#xD;
    disregarded.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&lt;br /></ReasonsForNotNeeding>
          <BriefOutline>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A project glossary defines the terms used during all phases of the project. There is a short definition for each term.&#xD;
&lt;/p></BriefOutline>
          <RepresentationOptions>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This is a simple alphabetical listing of domain terms and their definitions. It can be captured in a spreadsheet,&#xD;
    document, or published on a Wiki site to simplify access and maintenance.&#xD;

          <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h3>
    <font size="5">What is a Metric?</font>
</h3>
<p>
    We distinguish between measure and metric. To clarify, let's start by defining what is meant by measure and by metric.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Measure</b>: A raw data item that is directly measured, and that will be used to calculate a metric.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Metric</b>: An interpretation of a measure or a set of measures that you use to guide your project. For example,
        recording how many test cases have passed and how many have failed are measures. Interpreting what level of quality
        this indicates and how it reflects the team's progress within the current iteration is a metric.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    <font size="5">Why Measure?</font>
</h3>
<p>
    Measurements will mainly help you to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Communicate effectively</b>. Measurement supports effective communication among team members and project
        stakeholders.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Identify and correct problems early</b>. Measurement enables you to identify and manage potential problems early
        in the development lifecycle.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Make informed trade-offs</b>. Measurement helps objectively assess the impact of decisions, helping&nbsp;the
        team&nbsp;make trade-off decisions to best meet project goals.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Tune estimations</b>. Recording schedule, progress, and expenditures for projects will help team members to make
        more reliable estimations in the future.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    <font size="5">Potential Challenges</font>
</h3>
<p>
    There are several dangers when it comes to metrics:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div align="left">
            <b>They can be too costly</b>. The benefit provided by the metric must exceed the cost of collecting it. Keep
            your measurements simple and easy to collect.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div align="left">
            <b>They're a poor substitute for communication</b>. Do not use metrics as a substitute for communication. Team
            members may help to decide which metrics make sense for the project. Apply metrics not so much to control the
            project but to help team to collaborate better. Asking people about their progress is a co-dependent way of
            gaining insight into progress.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div align="left">
            <b>They can be misleading</b>. No metric or collection of metrics is perfect. Furthermore, the measurements
            upon which they are based can be manipulated by the people capturing them. Don't rely simply upon metrics to
            manage a project.
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Effective metrics programs can be challenging to implement, though typically not because of the statistics and complex
    analysis often associated with metrics. Rather, the challenge lies in understanding which metrics add value to the
    project and to the company, and which procedures are most efficient for collecting and using these metrics.
</p>
<p>
    Consider implementing only a handful metrics. Importantly, do not collect metrics unless they help contribute to a goal
    of improving a defined area of your software development process. If you will not act on a metric, do not collect it.
    It is much more important to focus on a small number of metrics that are important to what you are trying to achieve
    right now, versus a larger set of metrics that may be "good to track".&nbsp;
</p>
<h3>
    <font size="5">Common Metrics</font>
</h3>
<p>
    Below are some common measures and associated metrics used in software development projects. These metrics help teams
    communicate, identify and correct problems early, make informed trade-offs, and tune estimations. Example of metrics
    coverage areas are listed below.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Software quality 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Defect backlog: Number of defects discovered respectively resolved per iteration
            </li>
            <li>
                Test case coverage: Number of test cases executed over total number of test cases
            </li>
            <li>
                Code coverage: % of code that have been tested
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Development productivity 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Velocity: Number of delivered points by iteration (see <a class="elementLink"

            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Development process effectiveness 
        <ul>
            <li>

<p>
    There are many other measures and metrics that may make sense, based on what you are trying to accomplish. For example,
    if you want to measure the quality of your architecture, you may choose to collect metrics related to coupling between
    different software packages (groups of related classes) by measuring extensibility, dependency, and responsibility of
    each package.

          <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h3>
    What is an Iteration
</h3>
<p>
    An iteration is a set period of time within a project in which you produce a stable, executable version of the product,
    together with any other supporting documentation, install scripts, or similar, necessary to use this release. The
    executable is demonstrable, allowing the team to demonstrate true progress to stakeholders, get feedback on how they
    are doing so that they can improve their understanding of what needs to be done, and how to do it. Each iteration
    builds upon the results of previous iteration, and will produce a product increment one step closer to the final
    product. Iterations are timeboxed, meaning the schedule for an iteration should be regarded as fixed, and the scope of
    the iteration's content actively managed to meet that schedule.
</p>
<p>
    At each iteration, artifacts are updated. It is said that this is a bit like "growing" software. Instead of developing
    artifacts one after another, in a pipeline fashion, they are evolving across the cycle, although at different rates.
</p>
<p>
    Iterative development is very disciplined: the iteration length is fixed; the objectives of iterations are carefully
    planned; the evaluation criteria are established when each iteration is planned; and the tasks and responsibilities of
    participants are well defined. Additionally, objective measures of progress are captured. Some reworking takes place
    from one iteration to the next, but this too is done in a structured fashion.
</p>
<p>
    Each iteration should address the most critical risks, and implement the highest-priority work items. This ensures that
    each iteration adds maximum stakeholder value, while reducing uncertainty. Iterative development is typically combined
    with frequent or continuous integration: as unit-tested components become available, they are integrated, then a build
    is produced and subjected to integration testing. In this way, the capability of the integrated software grows as the
    iteration proceeds, towards the goals set when the iteration was planned. Regular builds, such as daily or more
    frequent builds, let you break down the integration and test issues and spread them across the development cycle. These
    issues have often been the downfall of large projects because all problems were discovered at once during the single
    massive integration step, which occurred very late in the cycle, and where a single problem halts the whole team.
</p>
<h3>
    Why Iterate
</h3>
<p>
    The iterative approach has proven itself superior to the waterfall approach for a number of reasons:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        You are more likely to build an application that addresses user needs. Early specification of requirements often
        leads to unused features. The Standish Group has researched thousands of application development projects and has
        found that more than 45 percent of features are never used, while another 19 percent are used rarely&nbsp; (see
        Figure 2.3). In other words, typically more than half of the development effort is wasted on developing
        nonessential capabilities. To avoid this problem, you need to involve the customer in the development project and
        use an iterative approach that allows you to implement and validate the capabilities deemed most essential in each
        iteration. This approach allows not only early validation of key capabilities but also addition of new capabilities
        late in the project.
    </li>
    <li>
        Integration is not one "big bang" at the end of a project. Leaving integration to the end results in time- and
        budget-consuming rework. To avoid this, an iterative approach breaks a project down into smaller iterations, each
        evolving executable code that is continuously integrated to enable rapid feedback and minimize later revision.
    </li>
    <li>
        Risks are usually discovered or addressed during early iterations. With the iterative approach, risks are more
        likely to be identified and addressed in early iterations. As an example, if there is a risk that a stakeholder
        will not be happy with the functionality you are developing, iterative development will encourage you to&nbsp;
        implement the most essential capabilities partially and demonstrate them to key stakeholders to make sure that you
        are on the right track.
    </li>
    <li>
        Your ability to work effectively is fine-tuned. During early iterations, team members are walking through all
        lifecycle activities, from requirements capture and test definition to development, implementation, and testing.
        Consequently, they can make sure they have the tools, skills, organizational structure, and so on to work
        effectively.
    </li>
    <li>
        Management has a way of making tactical changes to the product. Management can make changes to the product along
        the way-to compete with other new products, for example. Iterative development allows you to evolve partial
        implementations of the end product quickly and use these for quick release of a reduced-scope product to counter a
        competitor's move.
    </li>
    <li>
        Reuse is facilitated. It is easier to identify common parts as they are being partially designed or implemented in
        iterations than to recognize them at the beginning. Discussions and reviews of the design in early iterations allow
        team members to spot potential opportunities for reuse and then develop a mature common code for these
        opportunities in subsequent iterations.
    </li>
    <li>
        Defects can be found and corrected over several iterations. This capability results in a robust architecture and a
        high-quality application. Flaws are detected in early iterations, rather than during a massive testing phase at the
        end. Performance bottlenecks are discovered while they can still be addressed instead of creating panic on the eve
        of delivery.
    </li>
    <li>
        Project personnel are better used. Many organizations match their use of a waterfall approach with a pipeline
        organization: the analysts send the completed requirements to designers, who send a completed design to
        programmers, who send components to integrators, who send a system to testers. These many handoffs are sources of
        errors and misunderstandings and make people feel less responsible for the final product. An iterative process
        encourages widening the scope of expertise of the team members, allowing them to play many roles and thus enabling
        a project manager to make better use of the available staff and simultaneously remove problematic handoffs.
    </li>
    <li>
        Team members learn along the way. The project members have several opportunities within a development cycle to
        learn from their mistakes and improve their skills from one iteration to another. More training opportunities can
        be discovered as a result of assessing the earlier iterations.
    </li>
    <li>
        The development process itself is improved and refined along the way. The iteration assessment allows the team to
        not only look at the project status from a product or scheduling perspective but also analyze what can be improved
        in the next iteration in both the organization and the process.&nbsp;One technique for doing so is to hold a
        retrospective.
    </li>

    <strong><em>Figure 2.3. Most Features Implemented Are Never or Rarely Used.<br />
    </em></strong><em>According to the Standish Group, an amazing 45 percent of features implemented are never used, while
    another 19 percent are used only rarely. If features never used were not implemented in the first place, development
    time would be cut in about half. Further, since productivity is typically measured in the form of lines of code or
    functionality delivered, this improvement would not register as a productivity increase using standard productivity
    measures.</em>
</p>
<h3>
    Iteration Length
</h3>
<p>
    Iterations are typically 4 weeks long, although some teams will work with iterations as short as a week or as long as
    six weeks. For factors driving iteration length, see Table 1.

          <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h3>
    What is a Risk?
</h3>
<p>
    A risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, will have a negative or positive effect on one or more
    project objectives [<a class="elementLinkWithUserText"
    href="./../../../core.mgmt.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.mgmt_D80619F3.html#PMI"
    guid="_JlTPUM6aEdyuBO4ZIzcyig">PMI</a>]. Project risks may be seen as threats or opportunities. The latter means that
    taking a calculated risk may bring, for example, competitive advantage for a product or organization. If there are
    benefits associated with an opportunity, then you can take certain degrees of risk for a project to be successful [<a
    class="elementLinkWithUserText"
    href="./../../../core.mgmt.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.mgmt_D80619F3.html#SEI99"
    guid="_JlTPUM6aEdyuBO4ZIzcyig">SEI99</a>].
</p>
<p>
    In everyday life a risk is an exposure to loss or injury: A factor, thing, element, or course involving uncertain
    danger. Similarly, in software development a risk is something that can compromise the success of a project. Examples
    of potential sources of risk in software development are listed below (see [<a class="elementLinkWithUserText"
    href="./../../../core.mgmt.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.mgmt_D80619F3.html#SEI99"

<h3>
    Risk Attributes
</h3>
<p>
    You can record as much information as you like or need about your risks. You will find a list of common risk attributes
    following.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Risk Description:</b> A description of the risk detailing the impact for the project if this risk becomes a
        problem (that is, it becomes a reality).
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Risk Category</b>: Risk identification is usually more easily done when there is a "mental framework" in place
        to ensure that potential areas of risk are not overlooked. One way of doing this is to divide risks into categories
        (such as technical, project management, organizational, and external), to ensure that all aspects of the project
        which are prone to risk are covered.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Risk Type:</b> Used to classify the risk as:
    </li>
    <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
        <ul>
            <li>
                Direct or Indirect risk: if the project has or does not have a large degree of control over the risk
            </li>
            <li>
                Resource&nbsp;risk: organization, people, funding, or time
            </li>
            <li>
                Business risk
            </li>
            <li>
                Technical risk: scope, technology, or external dependency
            </li>
            <li>
                Schedule risk
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Risk Probability:</b> How likely the risk event will happen. This is usually represented as a scale of values
        (for example: High, Medium, Low). Probability is one of the most difficult quantities to judge accurately.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Risk Impact</b> (level): If this risk becomes a problem, what will the impact on the project be? This is not the
        actual <b>description</b> of the impact, but the <b>level</b> of impact. As the risk probability, it is usually
        represented as a scale. This attribute is also sometimes called the <b>severity</b> of the risk.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Risk Magnitude</b>: To be able to rank and define which risks need to be mitigate first, the <b>Risk
        Probability</b> and <b>Risk Impact</b> attributes are often combined in a single <b>Risk</b> <b>Magnitude</b>
        indicator represented as a scale similar to the combined attributes.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Risk Response Strategies
</h3>
<p>
    The risk response should be in line with the significance of the risk. The strategies for handling risk cover two main
    types: negative risks and positive risks (or opportunities). Common response strategies for negative risks or threats
    include [<a class="elementLinkWithUserText"
    href="./../../../core.mgmt.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.mgmt_D80619F3.html"
    guid="_JlTPUM6aEdyuBO4ZIzcyig">BOE91</a>]:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Avoid</b>: Reorganize the project so that it cannot be affected by that risk (for example, removing work)
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Mitigate</b>: Define actions to reduce the probability or the impact of the risk, removing it from the top of
        the list
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Transfer</b>: Reorganize the project so that someone or something else bears the risk. It simply gives another
        party responsibility for its management. It doesn't eliminate the risk.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Common response strategies for positive risks or opportunities include:
</p>
<ul class="noindent">
    <li>
        <b>Exploit</b>: Add work or reorganize the project to make sure that the opportunity occurs (it is the reverse of
        avoid)
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Enhance</b>: Define actions to increase the probability or the positive impact of the risk (this is the reverse
        of mitigate)
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Share</b>: Allocate the ownership of the opportunity to a third party who is best able to capture the
        opportunity for the benefit of the project.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Another response strategy for both threats or opportunities is to <b>Accept</b>: Decide to live with the risk, and
    define a contingency plan.
</p>
<p>
    Some scenarios for software development may help to make these concepts more clear:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        You need to use a new framework. A risk avoidance strategy could be to drop this new framework and use another one
        that is already understood by the team.
    </li>
    <li>
        The application you are developing needs to communicate with a legacy system. A risk transfer strategy would be to
        have the legacy support team be responsible for providing the APIs to access the legacy system.
    </li>
    <li>
        You need to use new middleware. A risk mitigation strategy could be to build a prototype using this new middleware
        to validate that it will provide the features you need for your application.
    </li>
    <li>
        Your integrator is the only one who knows how to integrate the different components of your application. A
        contingency plan could be to identify a resource on another project that you could bring on if your integrator is
        sick, leaves the company, and so on.
    </li>

    Agile Estimation

<p>
    There are three main concepts you need to understand to do agile estimation, see [<a class="elementLinkWithUserText"

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Estimation of Size</strong> gives a high-level estimate for the work item, typically measured using a
        neutral unit such as points
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Velocity</strong> tells us how many points this project team can deliver within an iteration;
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Estimation of Effort</strong> translates the size (measured in points) to a detailed estimate of effort
        typically using the units of Actual Days or Actual Hours. The estimation of effort indicates how long it will take
        the team member(s) to complete the assigned work item(s).

    <strong>Points</strong> is a relative measure that can be used for agile estimation of size.&nbsp;The team decides how
    big a point is, and based on that size, determines how many points each work item is. To make estimation go fast, use
    only full points, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and so on, rather than fractions of a point, such 0.25, or 1.65 points. To get
    started, look at 10 or so representative work items, give the smallest the size of one point, and then go through all
    other work items and give them a relative point estimate based on that point. Note that points are used for high-level
    estimates, so do not spend too much time on any one item. This is especially true for work items of lower priority, to
    avoid wasting effort on things that are unlikely to be addressed within the current iteration.
</p>
<p>
    A key benefit of points is that they are neutral and relative. Let's say that Ann is 3 times more productive than Jack.
    If Ann and Jack agree that work item A is worth 1 point, and they both think work item B is roughly 5 times as big,
    they can rapidly agree that work item B is worth 5 points. Ann may however think work item B can be done in 12 hours,
    while Jack thinks it can be done in 36 hours. That is fine, they may disagree about the actual effort required to do
    it, but we do not care at this point in time, we only want the team to agree on the relative size. We will later use
    Velocity to determine how much 'size', or how many points, the team can take on within an iteration.
</p>
<p>
    One project team may say that a work item of a certain size is worth 1 point. Another project team would estimate the
    same sized work item to be worth 5 points. That is fine, as long as you are consistent within the same project. Make
    sure that the entire team is involved in assessing size, or at least that the same people are involved in all your size
    estimates, to ensure consistency within your project. We will see how the concept of velocity will fix also this
    discrepancy in a point meaning different things to different project teams.
</p>
<p>
    You can also use other measures of size, where the most common alternative is Ideal Days. See for example [<a
    class="elementLinkWithUserText"
    href="./../../../core.tech.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.tech_6CCF393.html"
    guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">COH05</a>] for more information.
</p>
<h4>
    Velocity
</h4>
<p>
    Velocity is a key metric used for iteration planning. It indicates how many points are delivered upon within an
    iteration for a certain team and project. As an example, a team planned to accomplish 20 points in the first iteration.
    At the end of the iteration, they noticed that they only delivered upon 14 points, their velocity was hence 14. For the
    next iteration, they may plan for fewer points, let's say 18 points, since they think they can do a little better than
    in previous iteration. In this iteration, they delivered 17 points, giving them a velocity of 17.
</p>
<p>
    Expect the velocity to change from iteration to iteration. Some iterations go smoother than others, and points are not
    always identical in terms of effort. Some team members are more effective than others, and some problems end up being
    harder than others. Also, changes to the team structure, learning new skills, changes to the tool environment, better
    teaming, or more overhead with meetings or tasks external to the project will all impact velocity. In general, velocity
    typically increases during the project as the team builds skills and becomes more cohesive.
</p>
<p>
    Velocity compensates for differences between teams in terms of how big a point is. Let's assume that project team Alpha
    and project team Beta are equally efficient in developing software, and they run the same project in parallel. Team
    Alpha, however, assesses all work items as being worth 3 times as many points as team Beta's estimates. Team Alpha
    assesses work item A, B, C, and D to correspond to 30 points, and team Beta estimates the same work items to correspond
    to 10 points. Both teams deliver upon those 4 work items in the next iteration, giving team Alpha a velocity of 30, and
    team Beta a velocity of 10. It may sound as if team Alpha is more effective, but let's look at what happens when they
    plan the next iteration. They both want to take on work item E-H, which team Alpha has estimated to be 30 points, and
    team Beta as normal has estimated to be 1/3 as many points, or 10 points. Since a team can typically take on as many
    points as indicated by their velocity, they can both take on all of E-H. The end result is that it does not matter how
    big a point is, as long as you are consistent within your team.
</p>
<p>
    Velocity also averages out the efficiency of different team members. Let's look at an example; Let's assume that Ann
    always works 3 times as fast as Jack and Jane. Ann will perhaps deliver 9 points per iteration, and Jack and Jane 3
    points each per iteration. The velocity of that 3-person team will be 15 points. As mentioned above, Ann and Jack may
    not agree on how much effort is associated with a work item, but they can agree on how many points it is worth. Since
    the team velocity is 15, the velocity will automatically translate the point estimate to how much work can be taken on.
    As you switch team members, or as team members become more or less efficient, your velocity will change, and you can
    hence take on more or less points. This does however not require you to change the estimate of the size. The size is
    still the same, and the velocity will help you to calculate how much size you can deliver upon with the team at hand
    for that iteration.
</p>
<h4>
    Estimation of Effort
</h4>
<p>
    Estimation of Effort translates the size (measured in points) to a detailed estimate of effort typically using the
    units of Actual Days or Actual Hours. As you plan an iteration, you will take on a work item, such as detail, design,
    implement and test a scenario, which may be sized to 5 points. Since this is still a reasonably big work item, break it
    down&nbsp;into a number of smaller work items, such as 4 separate work items for Detailing, Designing, Implementing and
    Testing Server portion, and Implementing and Testing Client portion of the scenario. Team members are asked to sign up
    for the tasks, and then detail the&nbsp;estimate of the actual effort, measured in hours or days, for their tasks. In
    this case, the following actual estimates were done (with person responsible within parenthesis):
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Detailing scenario (Ann): 4 hours
    </li>
    <li>
        Designing scenario (Ann and Jack):&nbsp; 6 hours
    </li>
    <li>
        Implementing and Testing Server portion of scenario (Jack): 22 hours&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Implementing and Testing Client portion of scenario (Ann): 12 hours
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Total Effort Estimate for Scenario:</strong> 44 hours
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    If other people would be assigned to the tasks, the estimated actual hours could be quite different. There is hence no
    point doing detailed estimates until you know who will do the work, and what actual problems you will run into. Often,
    some level of analysis and design of the work item needs to take place before a reasonable estimate can be done.
    Remember that estimates are still estimates, and a person assigned to a task should feel free (and be encouraged) to
    re-estimate the effort required to complete the task, so we have a realistic view of progress within an iteration.

    Introduction to Risk Management
</h3>
<p>
    Every project contains some measure of uncertainty. <strong>Risk Management</strong>&nbsp;deals with this uncertainty,
    trying to understand its&nbsp;potential influence on the project. The purpose of Risk Management is to increase the
    probability and impact of positive events and decrease the probability and impact of events adverse to the project [<a
    class="elementLinkWithUserText"
    href="./../../../core.mgmt.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.mgmt_D80619F3.html"
    guid="_JlTPUM6aEdyuBO4ZIzcyig">PMI</a>]. The project manager, team, and stakeholders should be involved in risk
    management.
</p>
<h3>
    Identify Risks
</h3>
<p>
    Identify risks as soon as the project starts and document them in the risk list.&nbsp;Continue identifying and managing
    risks throughout the project. A common mistake is to identify risks only at the beginning of the project and then only
    track the status of these initial risks. Revisit the risk list weekly, or as a minimum when performing iteration
    planning,&nbsp;and add any newly discovered risks to the list.
</p>
<h3>
    Prioritize Risks
</h3>
<p>
    Prioritize risks for further analysis or action. A good approach for prioritizing risks is to have an attribute called
    risk magnitude, a combination of the risk probability and the risk impact. Each iteration provides a chance&nbsp;for
    better understanding of stakeholder needs, the team capabilities, the technology at hand, and so on. Capture, qualify
    and prioritize risks as they arise. High magnitude risks are&nbsp;attacked first, thus&nbsp;improving the chances of
    project success and minimizing uncertainty.
</p>
<h3>
    Select Risk Response Strategies
</h3>
<p>
    You are trying to mitigate or tackle the high priority risks as early as possible in the project. In order to achieve
    this you need to get a good grip on the risks the project is faced with, and have clear strategies on how to mitigate
    or deal with them.&nbsp; Once you have chosen a set of risks to focus on, develop options and determine actions to
    enhance opportunities and reduce threats, selecting a strategy, as described in <a class="elementLinkWithType"
    href="./../../../core.mgmt.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/risk_AF5840DA.html"
    guid="_0bsLgMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Concept: Risk</a>. Sometimes strategies can be determined for each cause, rather than
    each risk, eliminating many risks at once.
</p>
<h3>
    Plan Risk Response
</h3>
<p>
    For each selected strategy, identify and assign tasks to apply the strategy to the given risk. Place those tasks on the
    work items list&nbsp;so they can be assigned to iterations. Keep a&nbsp;reference to the risk for traceability. The
    effort must be appropriate to the magnitude of the risk. Avoid spending more preventing a threat than the impact from
    the risk if it occurs.
</p>
<h3>
    Monitor Risks
</h3>
<p id="comment_text_4">
    Follow up regularly on risk-mitigation actions. Risk reviews should be held&nbsp;when&nbsp;assessing the results during
    a project milestone to determine whether the information about project risks is up to date, and to assess whether any
    changes are necessary. The team may decide to try another strategy if the chosen strategy does not reduce/increase the
    magnitude of a risk.

    Most iterative software development processes recommend that changes not be introduced during an iteration. The main
    idea is that the iterations should be short and with clearly defined scope so that they can be time-boxed.
</p>
<p>
    To limit scope within an iteration, change requests are reviewed and prioritized as soon as possible, but are not
    assigned for implementation until a future iteration via the work items list.
</p>
<p>
    Since iterations are relatively short this should not cause undue delay in dealing with urgent and important change
    requests.
</p>
<p>
    One notable exception is a defect discovered during testing that prevents the team from meeting the objectives of the
    iteration. In this case it is reasonable to assign the work item to the current iteration as this does not represent a
    scope change, it represents unfinished work.
</p>
<p>
    Consider the following when choosing the future iteration where the change request will be addressed:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Group similar change requests in the same iteration. For example multiple change requests focused on the same
        functionality or that are dependent on each other.
    </li>
    <li>
        Assign change requests that mitigate high risks to the earliest iteration possible.
    </li>

    A change set is a logical grouping of related changes made to the implementation and supporting artifacts. Change sets
    are defined for a specific purpose and encompass all changes made to achieve that purpose.
</p>
<p>
    Change sets allow for multiple related changes to be referred to as single item, simplifying tracking of&nbsp;that
    item's progress through the development lifecycle.
</p>
<p>
    The change set forms the basic unit of configuration control, accountability, and collaboration on the development
    team.&nbsp; Additionally, change sets track the dependencies between artifact changes that facilitate discovery and
    correction of configuration inconsistencies. The relationship between items in a change set can be used to verify that
    all related changes have been included in a build.
</p>
<p>
    Change sets have the following characteristics:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Change sets consist of changes that belong together and can be built and tested together.
    </li>
    <li>
        Change sets are owned by a single developer.
    </li>
    <li>
        Change sets represent small, testable changes to the system.

    Planning transition iterations
</h3>
<p>
    Software may be deployed into a production environment at the end of any Construction or Transition iteration.
    Deployment to production before the end of the project may be done to drive down risk by validating the application,
    deployment scripts, deployment environment, and to get valuable feedback from operations and systems teams, as well as
    end users. These early deployments are often done on a limited scale in terms of target audience or only partial
    applications are deployed. For the deployment to work, one or several iterations are focused on work necessary to
    successfully release the system. In the Transition phase, one or several iterations may be dedicated to preparing for a
    smooth deployment. The number of iterations depends on the complexity of the system and various other factors, as
    listed here. When planning for deployment, the Work Items list should be updated with relevant tasks related to these
    considerations:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Resolving defects
    </li>
    <li>
        Testing installation or deployment scripts to avoid surprises in actual deployment&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Updating any&nbsp;operations&nbsp;and support test environments used to simulate production problems
    </li>
    <li>
        Performing release-specific testing efforts, such as pilot or beta testing,to a subset of your end-user community
        where the system is deployed
    </li>
    <li>
        Conducting acceptance reviews with stakeholders, including a&nbsp;final release acceptance testing effort where
        people outside of the team are involved and decide whether it truly meets their needs
    </li>
    <li>
        Finalizing relevant documentation, such as operations and system manuals, end-user documentation and release notes
    </li>
    <li>
        Creating&nbsp;physical collateral, such as installation media
    </li>
    <li>
        Replacing or installing physical assets, or both, including workstations, servers, and network components
    </li>
    <li>
        Replacing existing software with new versions
    </li>
    <li>
        Updating existing databases, including any relevant data migration and database schema changes
    </li>
    <li>
        Production data population
    </li>
    <li>
        Training end users and operations&nbsp;and support staff
    </li>
    <li>
        Fixing any discrepancies discovered during the transition phase
    </li>
    <li>
        Setting up management and operational systems and processes
    </li>
    <li>
        Training the team that is taking over maintenance and evolution of the system
    </li>
    <li>
        Deploying the software to the production environment
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    When the team and stakeholders are reviewing late Construction and early Transition iterations, the team should gather
    feedback from actual stakeholders' use of the product and take that information into consideration when prioritizing
    the work for the next iteration.

<h3>
    Reviewing transition iterations
</h3>
<p>
    Transition iteration reviews have a different focus from other iterations in the project lifecycle. The goal is not to
    brainstorm about what&nbsp;features to develop next. Instead, reviews will assess the release management resources and
    procedures, the quality of the software,&nbsp;and how prepared users and operations teams are to face a move of the
    software into the production environment.

    This artifact provides a focal point for the entire team:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        It provides one list containing all requests for additional capabilities or enhancement for that application. Note
        that some of these requests may never be implemented, or be implemented in later projects.
    </li>
    <li>
        It provides one list of all the work to be prioritized, estimated, and assigned within the project. The risk list
        is prioritized separately.
    </li>
    <li>
        It provides one place to go to for the development team to understand what&nbsp;micro-increments&nbsp;need to be
        delivered, get references to material required to carry out the work, and report progress made.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    These are the typical work items that go on this list:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Use cases (and references to use-case specifications)
    </li>
    <li>
        System-wide requirements
    </li>
    <li>
        Changes and enhancement requests
    </li>
    <li>
        Defects
    </li>
    <li>
        Development tasks
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Work items can be very large in scope, especially when capturing requests for enhancements, such as "Support Financial
    Planning" for a personal finance application. To allow the application to be developed in micro-increments, work items
    are analyzed and broken down into smaller work items so that they can be assigned to an iteration, such as a use-case
    scenario for&nbsp;"Calculate Net Worth". Further breakdown may be required to identify suitable tasks to be assigned to
    developers, such as "Develop UI for Calculate Net Worth". This means that work items often have parent/child
    relationships, where the lowest level is a specification and tracking device for micro-increments.

          <BriefOutline>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact should consist of the following information for each work item:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Name and Description&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Priority&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Size Estimate&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        State&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        References&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Assigned work items should also contain the following:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Target Iteration or Completion Date&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Assignee&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Estimated Effort Remaining&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Hours Worked&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></BriefOutline>
          <RepresentationOptions>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The recommended representation for the&amp;nbsp;work items list is to&amp;nbsp;capture it&amp;nbsp;as a separate artifact,&#xD;
    represented by a spreadsheet or database table. See &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../core.mgmt.common.extend_supp/guidances/examples/work_items_list_F527B77D.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_nHomIDgzEdu4E8ZdmlYjtA&quot;>Example: Work Items List&lt;/a>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Alternatively, the work items list may be captured in tools such as project management, requirements management, or&#xD;
    change request. In fact, the work items list may&amp;nbsp;be spread over several tools, as&amp;nbsp;you may choose to keep&#xD;
    different types of work items in different repositories to take advantage of features in those tools.&amp;nbsp;For example,&#xD;
    you could use a requirements composition or management tool to track information about requirements, and use another&#xD;
    tool to capture defects.&amp;nbsp;Work items may start in one representation (such as in a spreadsheet) and move to more&#xD;
    sophisticated tools over time, as the number of work items and the metrics you wish to gather grows more sophisticated.&#xD;

    All teams have a process, although it may be ad-hoc. A defined process helps team members understand their&#xD;
    responsibilities and capture lessons learned. A team that follows an ad-hoc process is at risk of being confused in&#xD;
    terms of responsibilities, may miss opportunities to learn from experience, and is at risk of violating organizational&#xD;

    the size of the project or methodology followed by the team. The whole team (including customers, developers, managers,
    quality assurance team, technical writers, and everyone else involved with the project) collaborates with one purpose
    in mind: to achieve the goals for a project, delivering the results of a project on time and within budget. The whole
    team collaborates and constantly communicates on what the goals are and how they will be attained. <a

    It is good practice to keep this artifact brief, so you can release it to stakeholders as soon as possible, and to make
    the artifact easy for stakeholders to read and understand. You can accomplish this by including only the most important
    features and avoiding details of requirements.
</p>
<p>
    Projects that focus on product development might extend the marketing section and include a more detailed product
    position statement that is based on their needs and research.
</p>]]></KeyConsiderations>
          <ImpactOfNotHaving>If you do not state a vision, stakeholders and the development team might have different expectations of the project. This&#xD;
can lead to cancellation of the project. Misunderstandings and miscommunication about the strategy can cause the project to&#xD;
move from the original vision and create discrepancies in stakeholder expectations.</ImpactOfNotHaving>
          <Purpose><![CDATA[<p>
    This artifact provides a high-level basis for more detailed technical requirements. It captures the technical solution
    by describing the high-level stakeholder requests and constraints that give an overview of the reasoning, background,
    and context for detailed requirements. The vision serves as input for communicating the fundamental "what and why" for
    the project and provides a strategy against which all future decisions can be validated.
</p>
<p>
    The vision should rally team members behind an idea and give them the context for decision-making in the requirements
    area. The vision must be visible to everyone on the team.<br />

    If the vision serves a set of projects or an entire program, the overall vision might be divided into several vision&#xD;

          <KeyConsiderations><![CDATA[<ul>
    <li>
        When you document system-wide requirements, ensure that the needs of all of the stakeholders are represented. In
        particular, include the needs of those who are responsible for maintaining or supporting the system after it is
        delivered.
    </li>
    <li>
        Typically, there are some overlaps and gray areas between system-wide requirements and other requirements work
        products. For example, the authorization behavior of a system can be specified as use cases or as statements within
        system-wide requirements. The overall driving need is that no important requirements are missed or duplicated, and
        that there is an agreed upon approach for capturing and processing every type of requirement.
    </li>
    <li>
        System-wide requirements originate from many places. Documenting the source of the requirement is particularly
        important when you separate externally mandated requirements.
    </li>
    <li>
        Requirements are often thought of as "Qualitative" (specifying a quality or desirable characteristic) versus
        "Quantitative" (specifying a quantity). Qualitative requirements can sometimes be elaborated into quantitative
        requirements.
    </li>
    <li>
        A good quality requirement is one that you can verify, either through testing or some other objective evaluation.
    </li>
    <li>
        You must evaluate system-wide requirements for cost, schedule impact, and level of contribution to business goals.
        Based on your evaluation, the system-wide requirements should be iteratively challenged, defended, and amended.
    </li>
</ul>]]></KeyConsiderations>
          <ImpactOfNotHaving>&lt;p>&#xD;
    If you do not adequately manage and meet system-wide requirements, you risk delivering a system that might be&#xD;
    unacceptable to stakeholders.&lt;br />&#xD;

    This artifact is used for the following purposes:

          <BriefOutline>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Organize system-wide requirements by a number of common themes or subcategories: the areas of performance and capacity,&#xD;
    availability, usability, security and privacy, maintainability, manageability, and flexibility. See the supporting&#xD;
    guidance for a description of the recommended categorization approach.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For each system-wide requirement, capture attributes such as the source and priority of the requirements, as described&#xD;
    by the associated requirements management guidance.&#xD;

    Overview
</h3>
<p>
    A use case describes the interactions between one of more&nbsp;<a class="elementLink"
    href="./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/actor_411726C.html"
    guid="_zGqO0MDpEduTGJ8i4u8TMw">Actor</a>s and the system in order to provide an observable result of value for the
    initiating actor.
</p>
<p>
    The functionality of a system is defined by different use cases, each of which represents a specific goal (to obtain
    the observable result of value) for a particular actor.
</p>
<p>
    In an automated teller machine shown in Figure 1, the Bank Customer can withdraw cash from an account, transfer funds
    between accounts, or deposit funds to an account. These correspond to specific goals that the actor has in using the
    system.&nbsp;
</p><br />

        </p>
    </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
    Each use case is associated with a goal of one of the actors. The collection of use cases constitutes all the possible
    ways of using the system. You should be able to determine the goal of a use case simply by observing its name.
</p>
<p>
    A use case describes the interactions between the actor(s) and the system in the form of a dialog between the actor(s)
    and the system, structured as follows:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        The actor &lt;&lt;does something&gt;&gt;
    </li>
    <li>
        The system &lt;&lt;does something in response&gt;&gt;
    </li>
    <li>
        The actor &lt;&lt;does something else&gt;&gt;
    </li>
    <li>
        The system ...
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    Each dialog of this form is called a "Flow of Events".
</p>
<p>
    Because there are many flows of events possible for achieving the goal (for example, the flow may differ depending upon
    specific input from the actor), and there are situations in which the goal cannot be achieved (for example, a required
    network connection is currently unavailable), each use case will contain several flows, including one "Basic Flow of
    Events" and several "Alternative Flows".
</p>
<p>
    The Basic Flow of Events specifies the interactions between the actor(s) and the system for the ideal case, where
    everything goes as planned, and the actor's goal (the observable result of value) is met. The basic flow represents the
    main capability provided by the system for this use case.
</p>
<p>
    As the name implies, Alternative Flows specify alternative interactions associated with the same goal.
</p>
<p>
    Closely related to use cases is the concept of a scenario. A scenario is a <em><strong>specific</strong></em> flow of
    events, for a <em><strong>specific</strong></em> set of inputs to the system, states of the system, and states of the
    system's environment. Scenarios are closely related to test cases.
</p>
<h3>
    Properties of Use Cases
</h3>
<h4>
    <a id="Name" name="Name">Name</a>
</h4>
<p>
    Each use case should have a name that indicates what is achieved by its interaction with the actors. The name may have
    to be several words to be understood. Note: No two use cases can have the same name.
</p>
<h4>
    <a id="Brief Description" name="Brief Description">Brief Description</a>
</h4>
<p>
    The brief description of the use case should reflect its purpose.
</p>
<h4>
    Flow of Events
</h4>
<h5>
    <a id="Flow of Events - Contents" name="Flow of Events - Contents">Flow of Events - Contents</a>
</h5>
<p>
    The flow of events should describe the use case's flow of events clearly enough for an outsider to easily understand.
    Remember, the flow of events should represent <em>what</em> the system does, not <em>how</em> the system is design to
    perform the required behavior.
</p>
<p>
    Follow these guidelines for the contents of the flow of events:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Describe how the use case starts and ends.
    </li>
    <li>
        Describe what data is exchanged between the actor and the use case.
    </li>
    <li>
        Do not describe the details of the user interface, unless it is necessary to understand the behavior of the
        system.&nbsp;Specifying user interface details too early will limit design options.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Describe the flow of events, not only the functionality. To enforce this, start every action with "When the actor
        ... ".
    </li>
    <li>
        Describe only the events that belong to the use case, and not what happens in other use cases or outside of the
        system.
    </li>
    <li>
        Avoid vague terminology.
    </li>
    <li>
        Detail the flow of events. Specify what happens when, for each action. Remember this text will be used to identify
        test cases.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    If you have used certain terms in other use cases, be sure to use the exact same terms in this use case, and
    that&nbsp;the meaning of the terms is consistent. To manage common terms, put them in a glossary.
</p>
<h5>
    <a id="Flow of Events - Structure" name="Flow of Events - Structure">Flow of Events - Structure</a>
</h5>
<p>
    The two main parts of the flow of events are <b>basic flow of events</b> and <b>alternative flows of events</b>. The
    basic flow of events should cover what "normally" happens when the use case is performed. The alternative flows of
    events cover behavior of optional or exceptional character in relation to the normal behavior, and also variations of
    the normal behavior. You can think of the alternative flows of events as detours from the basic flow of events, some of
    which will return to the basic flow of events and some of which will end the execution of the use case.
</p>
<p>
    The straight arrow in Figure 2 represents the basic flow of events, and the curves represent alternative paths in
    relation to the normal. Some alternative paths return to the basic flow of events, whereas others end the use case.

</p>
<p class="picturetext">
    Both the basic and alternative flows should be further structured into steps or sub-flows. In doing this, your main
    goal should be readability of the text. A&nbsp;guideline is that a sub-flow should be a segment of behavior within the
    use case that has a clear purpose, and is "atomic" in the sense that you do either all or none of the actions
    described.
</p>
<h4 class="picturetext">
    <a id="Special Requirements" name="Special Requirements">Special Requirements</a>
</h4>

    In the Special Requirements of a use case, you describe all the requirements associated with&nbsp;the use case that are
    not covered by the flow of events. These are non-functional requirements that will influence the design. See also the

<p>
    A <strong>precondition</strong> is the state of the system and its&nbsp;environment that is required before the use
    case can be started.&nbsp;Post-Conditions are&nbsp;the states the system can be in after the use case has ended. It can
    be&nbsp;helpful to use the&nbsp;concepts of <b>precondition</b> and <b>post-condition</b> to clarify how the flow of
    events starts and ends. However, only use them only if the audience for the description of the use case agrees that it
    is helpful. Figure 3 shows an example.

          <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h3>
    Explanation
</h3>
<p>
    A use-case model is a model of how different types of users interact with the system to solve a problem.&nbsp; As such,
    it describes the goals of the users, the interactions between the users and the system, and the required behavior of
    the system in satisfying these goals.
</p>
<p>
    A use-case model consists of a number of model elements.&nbsp; The most important model elements are: use cases, actors
    and the relationships between them.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    A use-case diagram is used to graphically depict a subset of the model to simplify communications.&nbsp; There will
    typically be several use-case diagrams associated with a given model, each showing a subset of the model elements
    relevant for a particular purpose.&nbsp; The same model element may be shown on several use-case diagrams, but each
    instance must be consistent.&nbsp; If tools are used to maintain the use-case model, this consistency constraint is
    automated so that any changes to the model element (changing the name for example) will be automatically reflected on
    every use-case diagram that shows that element.
</p>
<p>
    The use-case model may contain packages that are used to structure the model to simplify analysis, communications,
    navigation, development, maintenance and planning.
</p>
<p>
    Much of the use-case model is in fact textual, with the text captured in the&nbsp;use-case specifications&nbsp;that are
    associated with each use-case model element.&nbsp;These specifications describe the flow of events of the use case.
</p>
<p>
    The use-case model serves as a unifying thread throughout system development. It is used as the primary specification
    of the functional requirements for the system, as the basis for analysis and design, as an input to iteration planning,
    as the basis of defining test cases and as the basis for user documentation&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<h3>
    Basic model elements
</h3>
<p>
    The use-case model contains, as a minimum, the following basic model elements.
</p>
<h4>
    Actor
</h4>
<p>
    A model element representing&nbsp;each actor. Properties include the actors name and brief description. See&nbsp;<a
    class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/actor_411726C.html"
    guid="_zGqO0MDpEduTGJ8i4u8TMw">Concept: Actor</a> for more information.
</p>
<h4>
    Use Case
</h4>
<p>
    A model element representing&nbsp;each use case. Properties include the use case name and use case specification.
    See&nbsp;Use Case artifact and <a class="elementLinkWithType"
    href="./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/use_case_BB199D1B.html"
    guid="_KudM0NcJEdqz_d2XWoVt6Q">Concept: Use Case</a> for more information.
</p>
<h4>
    Associations
</h4>
<p>
    Associations are used to describe the relationships between actors and the use cases they participate in. This
    relationship is commonly known as a "communicates-association".
</p>
<h3>
    Advanced model elements
</h3>
<p>
    The use-case model may also contain the following advanced model elements.
</p>
<h4>
    Subject
</h4>
<p>
    A model element that represents the boundary of the system of interest.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<h4>
    Use-Case Package
</h4>
<p>
    A model element used to structure the use case model to simplify analysis, communications, navigation, and
    planning.&nbsp; If there are many use cases or actors, you can use use-case packages to further structure the use-case
    model in much the same manner you use folders or directories to structure the information on your hard-disk.
</p>
<p>
    You can partition a use-case model into use-case packages for several reasons, including:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        To reflect the order, configuration, or delivery units in the finished system thus supporting iteration planning.
    </li>
    <li>
        To support parallel development by dividing the problem into bite-sized pieces.
    </li>
    <li>
        To simplify communication with different stakeholders by creating packages for containing use cases and actors
        relevant to a particular stakeholder.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Generalizations
</h4>
<p>
    A relationship&nbsp;between actors to support re-use of common properties.
</p>
<h4>
    Dependencies
</h4>
<p>
    A number of dependency types between use cases are defined in UML. In particular, &lt;&lt;extend&gt;&gt; and
    &lt;&lt;include&gt;&gt;.
</p>
<p>
    &lt;&lt;extend&gt;&gt; is used to include optional behavior from an extending use case in an extended use case.
</p>
<p>
    &lt;&lt;include&gt;&gt; is used to include common behavior from an included use case into a base use case in order to
    support re-use of common behavior.
</p>
<p>
    The latter is the most widely used dependency and is useful for:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Factoring out behavior from the base use case that is not necessary for the understanding of the primary purpose of
        the use case to simplify communications.
    </li>
    <li>
        Factoring out behavior that is in common for two or more use cases to maximize re-use, simplify maintenance and
        ensure consistency.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Example Use-Case Diagram
</h3>
<p>
    Figure 1 shows a use-case diagram from an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) use-case model.
</p>
<p>
    &nbsp;<img alt="Figure 1: ATM Use-Case Diagram" src="core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/resources/atm_uc_diagram.gif" />
</p>
<p>
    Figure 1: ATM Use-Case Diagram
</p>
<p>
    This diagram shows the subject (atm:ATM), four actors (Bank Customer, Bank, Cashier and Maintenance Person), five use
    cases (Withdraw Cash, Transfer Funds, Deposit Funds, Refill Machine and Validate User), three &lt;&lt;includes&gt;&gt;
    dependencies, and the associations between the performing actors and the use cases.
</p>
<p>
    The use cases Withdraw Cash, Deposit Funds, and Transfer Funds all need to include how the customer is identified to
    the system. This behavior can be extracted to a new inclusion use case called Validate User, which the three base use
    cases &lt;&lt;include&gt;&gt;. The base use cases are independent of the method used for identification, and it is
    therefore encapsulated in the inclusion use case. From the perspective of the base use cases, it does not matter
    whether the method for identification is to read a magnetic bank card, or perform a retinal scan. They only depend on
    the result of Validate Customer.
</p>
<p>
    Note that Figure 1 is only a partial view of the use-case model. The complete use-case model also includes descriptions
    of each actor, descriptions of each use case, and use-case specifications for each use case.&nbsp; For a more complete
    example of this use case model see&nbsp;<a class="elementLink"

    To fully understand the system's purpose, you must know who the system is for, that is: Who will use the system? The
    answer to this question is: the Actors.
</p>
<p>
    An Actor is a role that a person or external system plays&nbsp;when interacting with the system.&nbsp; Instances of an
    Actor can be an individual or an external system, however each Actor&nbsp;provides a
    unique&nbsp;and&nbsp;important&nbsp;perspective on the system that is shared by every instance of the Actor.
</p>
<p>
    This difference between an actor and an instance of an actor is illustrated below.&nbsp;&nbsp;Figure 1 shows a case in
    which Ivar and Mark are operators of a recycling machine. When they are using the machine in this capacity, each is
    represented by an instance of the actor called Operator that expects certain functionality of the system (Print Daily
    Reports in this example).
</p>

<blockquote style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" dir="ltr">
    <p>
        <strong>Figure 1:&nbsp;Example Actor with multiple instances</strong>&nbsp;
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    Conversely, the same user can act as several actors (that is, the same person can take on different roles). In Figure
    2, Charlie uses the Depot-Handling System primarily as Depot Manager, but sometimes he also uses the Depot-Handling
    System as an ordinary Depot Staff member. Each of these actors expects different functionality of the system.
</p>
<p>

<blockquote style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" dir="ltr">
    <p>
        <strong>Figure 2: Example of user playing different roles</strong><br />
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    Actors help you to identify external interfaces and to determine the scope the system (what is in the system, vs. what
    is outside the system boundary).&nbsp; Each&nbsp;Actor typically has associated use cases which describe what that
    particular&nbsp;actor expects of the system.&nbsp; It will be very difficult, if not impossible,&nbsp;to assess the
    completeness of the set of Use Cases without the context provided by the associated Actors. Furthermore, missing an
    actor may result in&nbsp;missing important stakeholder perspectives, resulting&nbsp;in a solution that does not meet
    all&nbsp;stakeholder needs.
</p>
<p>
    Hence, identifying the Actors for the system&nbsp;should be done early in the lifecycle.

    Attributes are a very important source of requirements information. Just as every person has attributes (age, hair
    color, gender), each requirement has a source, a relative importance, and time it was created. Attributes do more than
    simply clarify a&nbsp;requirement.&nbsp; If created properly, they can yield significant information about the state of
    the system. Just as you can run a database query to find all men with brown hair over age 30, given our human example,
    you can run queries on the status of requirements to find&nbsp;all high-priority requirements from the customer in the
    last 30 days. <a href="./../../../core.tech.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.tech_6CCF393.html"

</p>
<h4>
    Examples of attributes
</h4>
<p>
    Listed below is a partial list of some common attributes and a brief description of their meaning. Some attributes are
    best described as a number, date, Boolean (true or false) or a text field for entering free format comments. Other
    attributes can be expressed as lists. For instance, priority type is a list of high, medium, and low; Weekday is a list
    which includes Monday, Tuesday, and so on.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Source</em> - Person, document or other origin of a given requirement.&nbsp; This is&nbsp;useful&nbsp;for
    determining whom to call for questions or for grouping&nbsp;requirements according to the person making the demands.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Priority</em> - Statement of relative importance of the requirement, either to the system (mandatory, critical,
    optional) or to other requirements (high, medium, low). It is good to track the mandatory or high-priority
    items&nbsp;as an indication of how well the system will meet the greatest needs or for compliance-related metrics.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Assigned to</em> - Who in the organization is responsible for making sure the requirement is met (person's name or
    organizational name).
</p>
<p>
    <em>Comments</em> - Reviewer's or writer's comments on a requirement.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Difficulty</em> - An indication of the level of effort needed or how hard it will be to implement the requirement
    (high, medium, low).
</p>
<p>
    <em>Status</em> - Degree of completeness (completed, partial, not started).
</p>
<p>
    <em>Risk</em> - Confidence measure on the likelihood of meeting (or not meeting) a requirement. Could be high, medium,
    low or the integers one through ten.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Due By</em> - Date the requirement must be provided.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Method of verification</em> - Qualification type to be used to verify that a requirement has been met: analysis,
    demonstration, inspection, test, and walkthrough.

          <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h3>
    Introduction
</h3>
<p>
    During testing, you will encounter failures related to the execution of your tests in different forms, such as code
    defects, user errors, program malfunctions, and general problems. This&nbsp;concept discusses some ways to conduct
    failure analysis and then to report your findings.
</p>
<h3>
    Failure Analysis
</h3>
<p>
    After you have run your tests, it is good practice to identify inputs for review of the results of the testing effort.
    Some likely sources are defects that occurred during the execution of test scripts, change request metrics, and test
    log details.
</p>
<p>
    Running test scripts results in errors of different kinds such as uncovered defects, unexpected behavior, or general
    failure of the test script to run properly. When you run test scripts, one of the most important things to do is to
    identify causes and effects of failure. It is important to differentiate failures in the system under test&nbsp;from
    those related to the tests themselves.
</p>
<p>
    Change request metrics are useful in analyzing and correcting failures in the testing. Select metrics that will
    facilitate creation of incident reports from a collection of change requests.
</p>
<p>
    Change request metrics that you may find useful in your failure analysis include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        test coverage
    </li>
    <li>
        priority
    </li>
    <li>
        impact
    </li>
    <li>
        defect trends
    </li>
    <li>
        density
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Finally, one of the most critical sources of your failure analysis is the test log. Start by gathering the test log's
    output during the implementation and execution of the tests. Relevant logs might come from many sources; they might be
    captured by the tools you use (both test execution and diagnostic tools), generated by custom-written routines your
    team has developed, output from the target test items themselves, and recorded manually be the tester. Gather all of
    the available test log sources and examine their content. Check that all the scheduled testing executed to completion,
    and that all the needed tests&nbsp;have been scheduled.
</p>
<h3>
    Self-Documenting Tests
</h3>
<p>
    For automated tests it is a best practice for the test itself to examine the results and clearly report itself as
    passing or failing. This provides the most efficient way to run tests such that whole suites of tests can be run with
    each test in turn determining whether it has passed or failed without the need for human intervention. When authoring
    self-documenting tests, take extra care to ensure that the analysis of the results considers all possibilities.
</p>
<h3>
    Recording Your Findings
</h3>
<p>
    Once you have conducted your failure analysis, you may decide to formalize the results of this analysis by recording
    your findings in a report. There are several factors that go into deciding whether to record your failure analysis in a
    report. Some of the key factors include: level of testing formality, complexity of the testing effort, and the need to
    communicate the testing results to the entire development team. In less formal environments, it may be sufficient to
    record your failure analysis in&nbsp;a test evaluation summary.

    Introduction
</h3>
<p>
    There is much more to testing computer software than simply evaluating the functions, interface, and response-time
    characteristics of a target-of-test.&nbsp;Additional tests must focus on characteristics and attributes, such as the
    target-of-test.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        integrity (resistance to failure)
    </li>
    <li>
        ability to be installed and executed on different platforms
    </li>
    <li>
        ability to handle many requests simultaneously
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    To achieve this, many different types of tests are implemented and executed.&nbsp;Each test type has a specific
    objective and support technique.&nbsp;Each technique focuses on testing one or more characteristics or attributes of
    the target-of-test.
</p>
<p>
    The following sections list the types of test based on the most obvious quality&nbsp;attributes they address.
</p>
<h3>
    Types of test for&nbsp;Functionality
</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Function test:</strong>&nbsp;Tests focused on validating the target-of-test functions as intended, providing
    the required services, methods, or use cases. This test is implemented and executed against different targets-of-test,
    including units, integrated units, applications, and systems.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Security test:</strong>&nbsp;Tests focused on ensuring the target-of-test data (or systems) are accessible only
    to those actors for which they are intended. This test is implemented and executed on various targets-of-test.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Volume test:</strong>&nbsp;Tests focused on verifying the target-of-test's ability to handle large amounts of
    data, either as input and output or resident within the database.&nbsp;Volume testing includes test strategies such as
    creating queries that would return the entire contents of the database, or that would have so many restrictions that no
    data is returned, or where the data entry has the maximum amount of data for each field.
</p>
<h3>
    Types of test for&nbsp;Usability
</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Usability test:</strong>&nbsp;Tests that focus on:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        human factors
    </li>
    <li>
        esthetics
    </li>
    <li>
        consistency in the user interface
    </li>
    <li>
        online and context-sensitive help
    </li>
    <li>
        wizards and agents
    </li>
    <li>
        user documentation
    </li>
    <li>
        training materials
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Integrity test:</strong>&nbsp;Tests that focus on assessing the target-of-test's robustness (resistance to
    failure), and technical compliance to language, syntax, and resource usage.&nbsp;This test is implemented and executed
    against different targets-of-tests, including units and integrated units.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Structure test</strong>: Tests that focus on assessing the target-of-test's adherence to its design and
    formation.&nbsp;Typically, this test is done for Web-enabled applications ensuring that all links are connected,
    appropriate content is displayed, and no content is orphaned.
</p>
<h3>
    Types of test for&nbsp;Reliability
</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Stress test:</strong>&nbsp; A type of reliability test that focuses on evaluating how the system responds under
    abnormal conditions.&nbsp;Stresses on the system could include extreme workloads, insufficient memory, unavailable
    services and hardware, or limited shared resources.&nbsp;These tests are often performed to gain a better understanding
    of how and in what areas the system will break, so that contingency plans and upgrade maintenance can be planned and
    budgeted for well in advance.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Benchmark test:</strong>&nbsp; A type of performance test that compares the performance of a new or unknown
    target-of-test to a known reference-workload and system.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Contention test:</strong>&nbsp; Tests focused on validating the target-of-test's ability to acceptably handle
    multiple actor demands on the same resource (data records, memory, and so on).
</p>
<h3>
    Types of test for Performance
</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Load test:</strong>&nbsp; A type of performance test used to validate and assess acceptability of the
    operational limits of a system under varying workloads while the system-under-test remains constant.&nbsp;In some
    variants, the workload remains constant and the configuration of the system-under-test is varied.&nbsp; Measurements
    are usually taken based on the workload throughout and in-line transaction response time.&nbsp;The variations in
    workload usually include emulation of average and peak workloads that occur within normal operational tolerances.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Performance profile:</strong> A test in which the target-of-test's timing profile is monitored, including
    execution flow, data access, function and system calls to identify and address both performance bottlenecks and
    inefficient processes.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Configuration test:</strong>&nbsp; Tests focused on ensuring the target-of-test functions as intended on
    different hardware and software configurations.&nbsp;This test might also be implemented as a system performance test.
</p>
<h3>
    Types of test for Supportability
</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Installation test:</strong>&nbsp; Tests focused on ensuring the target-of-test installs as intended on
    different hardware and software configurations, and under different conditions (such as insufficient disk space or
    power interruptions).&nbsp;This test is implemented and executed against applications and systems.

          <MainDescription><![CDATA[<p>
    A test case specifies the conditions that must be validated to enable an assessment of aspects of the system under
    test. A test case is more formal than a test idea; typically, a test case takes the form of a specification. In less
    formal environments, you can create test cases by identifying a unique ID, name, associated test data, and expected
    results.
</p>
<p>
    Test cases can be derived from many sources, and typically include a subset of the requirements (such as use cases,
    performance characteristics, and reliability concerns) and other types of quality attributes. For more information on
    types of tests and their relationships to quality test attributes, see <a class="elementLinkWithType"

          <ImpactOfNotHaving>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Without this artifact, it is difficult to validate system functionality. Because this artifact specifies the conditions&#xD;
    of acceptance between the stakeholders and the developers, without the artifact, it is difficult to establish exit&#xD;
    criteria and to demonstrate that the exit criteria have been met. If the original test cases have not been documented,&#xD;
    it is impossible to do regression testing.&#xD;
&lt;/p></ImpactOfNotHaving>
          <Purpose><![CDATA[<p>
    Use this artifact for the following purposes:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        To provide a way to capture test inputs, conditions, and expected results for a system
    </li>
    <li>
        To systematically identify aspects of the software to test
    </li>
    <li>
        To specify whether an expected result has been reached, based on the verification of a system requirement, set of
        requirements, or scenario
    </li>
</ul>]]></Purpose>
          <ReasonsForNotNeeding>&lt;p>&#xD;
    It might not be necessary to create this artifact to maintain or make small enhancements to existing systems, which&#xD;
    likely have existing test assets that you can use. You also might not need this artifact if you use a package&#xD;
    application that has its own set of test cases.&#xD;

          <ReasonsForNotNeeding>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact might not be required if the tests are simple or if testing is done on an informal basis. However, for&#xD;
    this approach to be successful, testers must track their processes, as they might need to recreate a problem scenario.&#xD;
    Alternatively, you can use automatic capture and playback tools to provide a record of testing.&#xD;

        There is no way to know which tests passed and which failed.&#xD;

    When you execute automated tests, test logs are automatically produced. Typically, the issue is not whether to produce&#xD;
    the test log, but whether to keep a record, and where to keep the records. For manual testing, the issue is whether to&#xD;
    keep a separate test log or to summarize the test results in another form.&#xD;

          <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h3>
    Definition
</h3>
<p>
    System-wide requirements are requirements that&nbsp;define necessary system quality attributes&nbsp;such as
    performance, usability and reliability, as well as global functional requirements&nbsp;that are not captured in
    behavioral requirements artifacts such as use cases.
</p>
<h3>
    System-wide&nbsp;Requirements Categories
</h3>
<p>
    System-wide&nbsp;requirements are categorized according to the FURPS+ model (Functional, Usability, Reliability,
    Performance, Supportability + constraints). Constraints&nbsp;include design, implementation, interfaces, physical
    constraints, and business rules. A description of each of these types of requirements follows.
</p>
<p>
    System-wide requirements and use cases, together, define the requirements of the system. These requirements support the
    features listed in the vision statement. Each requirement should&nbsp;support at least one feature, and each feature
    should be supported by at least one requirement.
</p>
<p>
    In general, <strong>functional</strong> requirements describe behavior and can be captured as&nbsp;use cases.
    <strong>Non-functional</strong> requirements are captured in a system-wide requirements specification.&nbsp;However,
    nonfunctional requirements that are closely associated with a particular use case are often captured within the
    use-case specification itself to simplify communication and maintenance.&nbsp;Similarly, there are global, or
    system-wide functional requirements that are often captured among the system-wide requirements for the same
    reasons.&nbsp;
</p>
<h4>
    Functional requirements
</h4>
<p>
    Functional requirements include all the over-arching, system-wide functional requirements that are not expressed as use
    cases. These functional requirements represent the main system features that are familiar within the business domain or
    technically oriented requirements such as auditing, licensing, localization, e-mail, online help, printing, reporting,
    security, system management, or workflow.
</p>
<h4>
    Usability requirements
</h4>
<p>
    Usability requirements include requirements based on human factors and user-interface issues such as accessibility,
    interface aesthetics, and consistency within the user interface.
</p>
<h4>
    Reliability requirements
</h4>
<p>
    Reliability requirements include aspects such as availability, accuracy, predictability, frequency of failure or
    recoverability of the system from shut-down failure.
</p>
<h4>
    Performance requirements
</h4>
<p>
    Performance requirements address concerns such as throughput of information through the system, system response time
    and resource usage.
</p>
<h4>
    Supportability requirements
</h4>
<p>
    Supportability requirements include&nbsp;requirements such as compatibility and the abilities to test, adapt, maintain,
    configure, install, scale, and localize the system.
</p>
<h4>
    + Constraints
</h4>
<p>
    The <strong>+</strong> of the FURPS+ acronym allows you to specify constraints, such as design, implementation,
    interfaces, physical constraints, and business rules:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Design constraints</strong> limit the design and state requirements on the approach that should be taken in
        developing the system.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Implementation constraints</strong> put limits on coding or construction (required standards, languages,
        tools, or platform)
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Interface constraints</strong> are requirements to interact with external systems, describing protocols or
        the nature of the information that is passed across that interface.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Physical constraints</strong> affect the hardware or packaging housing the system (shape, size, and
        weight).
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Business rules</strong> are policies or decisions that govern how the business operates. They may constrain
        the steps described in the us-case flow.
    </li>
</ul>]]></MainDescription>

    This artifact covers all of the steps to validate a specific aspect of an implementation element. For example, a test
    could ensure that the parameters of a method properly accept the uppermost and lowermost required values. A developer
    test specifies test entries, execution conditions, and expected results. These details are identified to evaluate a
    particular aspect of a scenario.
</p>
<p>
    When you collect developer tests for a specific implementation element, you can validate that the element performs as
    specified.
</p>
<p>
    The tests be self-documenting so that it is clear upon completion of the test whether the implementation element has
    run correctly.

          <KeyConsiderations></KeyConsiderations>
          <ImpactOfNotHaving>If you do not run developer tests, you cannot ensure that elements that you modify over time are working. This can inhibit&#xD;
iterative development and maintenance.</ImpactOfNotHaving>
          <Purpose><![CDATA[This artifact is used to evaluate whether an implementation element performs as specified.]]></Purpose>
          <ReasonsForNotNeeding>If you can embed the tests into the production code, you might not need a separate work product. Nonetheless, some level of&#xD;
support for developer testing is always necessary when you develop application software.</ReasonsForNotNeeding>
          <BriefOutline>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Although there is no predefined template for this work product, and testing tools affect how the work product is&#xD;
    handled, you should address the following issues:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Setup&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Inputs&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Script&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Expected Results&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Evaluation Criteria&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Clean-Up&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></BriefOutline>
          <RepresentationOptions>&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;>&#xD;
    Suggestions and options for representing this work product:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Suggestion: Automated code unit&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The most appropriate technique for running these tests is to use code that tests the implementation element scenarios&#xD;
    and that you can run regularly as you update the system during development.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    When code is the sole form of the tests, ensure that the code is self-documenting. The code should document the&#xD;
    specifications of the conditions you are testing and the setup or clean-up that is required for the test to run&#xD;
    properly.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Option: Manual instructions&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In some cases, you can use manual instructions. For example, when testing a user interface, a developer might follow a&#xD;
    script, explaining the implementation element. In this case, it is still valuable to create a test harness that goes&#xD;
    straight to the user interface. That way, the developer can follow the script without having to follow a complicated&#xD;
    set of instructions to find a particular screen or page.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Option: Embedded code&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    You can use certain technologies (such as Java(TM)5 Test Annotation) to embed tests in the implementation. In these&#xD;
    cases, there will be a logical work product, but it will be assimilated into the code that you are testing. When you&#xD;
    use this option, ensure that the code is self-documenting.&#xD;

    Introduction
</h3>
<p>
    At some point in your test effort, you may find it necessary to manage your test effort by creating test suites for
    your test assets.&nbsp;Maintaining test suites can take many different forms. To facilitate your testing, you may want
    to introduce some&nbsp;level of&nbsp;automation of your test suites.&nbsp;The fact that you've automated your test
    suites does not necessarily make your testing easier however. It may actually increase the maintenance burden of your
    suites.
</p>
<p>
    This guideline introduces you to useful heuristics on how to facilitate the maintenance of your automated test suites.
</p>
<h4>
    Plan your test&nbsp;suites
</h4>
<p>
    Automating your testing without planning increases&nbsp;the chances that testing will be ineffective
    and&nbsp;inefficient.&nbsp;Some level of planning should take place whether implicit or explicit.&nbsp;An essential
    part of any test plan is the definition of a strategy for test automation.&nbsp;Use your plan to articulate to the
    development team how you plan to maintain your test assets.&nbsp;In many cases, this is never done.&nbsp;The rest of
    the development team may be unaware of how you intend to maintain your tests.&nbsp;It is also a good practice to get
    the rest of the development team to understand that this maintenance can be a substantial part of the overall
    development effort.&nbsp;Use your test tooling to capture this information and treat this plan just like you would
    treat any other test asset in your test repository.
</p>
<h4>
    Centrally locate your test assets
</h4>
<p>
    To facilitate the maintenance of your automated test suites, locate your test assets in a repository that can be
    accessed by the development team.&nbsp;Many test automation environments provide test management tools that make it
    easier to organize and access your test assets by maintaining the test assets (test cases, test scripts, and test
    suites) in a common repository.
</p>
<p>
    In addition, some form of access control is enforced by the automation test tool.&nbsp;This eases the maintenance
    burden by ensuring the integrity of your test suites.&nbsp;You may choose to grant stakeholders and managers read-only
    access, whereas developers and testers at the practitioner level may have read/write access.
</p>
<h4>
    Treat your test assets like any other software
</h4>
<p>
    Software must be maintained.&nbsp;This also applies to the software in your test suites.&nbsp;Test cases and their
    associated test scripts, whether recorded or programmed, should be maintained.&nbsp;And just as software has different
    kinds of maintenance (e.g., corrective, preventative, or adaptive) so too do the assets in your automated test suites.
    As you lifecycle your test suites, identify, if only informally,&nbsp;how&nbsp;you plan to disposition the test suite
    corrective maintenance (e.g., syntactical errors in your scripts),&nbsp;preventative maintenance (e.g., where possible
    to write generalized test scripts), and adaptive maintenance (e.g., how you&nbsp;can use your test tooling to re-assign
    test&nbsp;assets within one suite to&nbsp;another suite or suites).&nbsp;This can be captured, as described in the
    section <strong>Plan Your Test Suites</strong> above, in your test plan.
</p>
<h4>
    Improve the testability of your test suites through collaboration with developers
</h4>
<p>
    It's one thing to say that your test suites will need to be maintained due to changes in the application, changes in
    the testing target, etc.&nbsp;It's quite another thing to actually determine whether a test suite needs to be
    revamped&nbsp;and, if it does, what test assets within it need to be addressed.
</p>
<p>
    One way to facilitate this is to use test suites as a way to communicate test decision to the developers.&nbsp;One way
    to perform continuous perfective maintenance of test suites is to think of your test suites as assets that belong to
    the development team rather than just the testers.&nbsp; You can perform a kind of perfective maintenance on test in
    the following ways:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        use test suites to raise the level of abstraction
    </li>
    <li>
        use test suites to provide focus for the developer
    </li>
    <li>
        use test suites to articulate areas that the developers would like testers to focus on
    </li>
    <li>
        make the construction and maintenance&nbsp;of test suites more efficient&nbsp;by understanding what area(s)
        developers want to focus on
    </li>
    <li>
        use test suites to clarify test targets with developers
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Don't be afraid to clean up your suites
</h4>
<p>
    Your test assets will evolve just as the application under test will.&nbsp;As requirements to the system change, the
    application will change as well.&nbsp;To maintain your test suites, you should continually&nbsp;check whether test
    assets are valid.&nbsp;If possible, validity checks should be performed after each new release of the software,
    preferably more frequently.&nbsp;Keeping your test suites relevant is a full-time job.&nbsp;Assume that changes in the
    software will lead to some degree of invalid tests within your test suites.&nbsp;Once these test assets have been
    identified as invalid, get rid of them.&nbsp;This will make the maintenance burden much more tolerable.&nbsp;Some
    automated test tooling environments make this task easier by providing ways to package outdated or invalid
    tests.&nbsp;In some cases, you may not be absolutely sure whether you want to completely get rid of tests within your
    test suite or even of getting rid of test suites altogether.&nbsp; To alleviate this burden, you can create packages
    for obsolete tests or test suites and dispose of tests or test suites by putting them in packages labeled for this
    purpose.

            <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h3>
    Introduction
</h3>
<p>
    Although the programming of automated tests should contribute to the overall test effort, it usually does not make up
    the entire test effort. In fact, test environments that are based on a complete automation approach end up spending
    more time on test automation than on testing. Before you begin the development of&nbsp;automated test scripts, consider
    first whether it is more efficient to perform manual testing. Some aspects of an application are more efficiently
    tested manually (for example, GUI testing versus data-drive testing). If you decide to program automated test scripts,
    examine what aspects of your test scripting can be automated and begin designing your scripts.
</p>
<h3>
    Design your automated tests
</h3>
<p>
    Without some level of design of your automated tests, introducing automation into your testing effort can lead to more
    problems than it solves. You should consider developing your automated tests according to a lifecycle with automation
    test requirements, design, testing of the automation tests, and implementation of the automation tests. This approach
    can be informal or formal depending on your project needs. By designing the programming of your automated tests, you
    can avoid spending time programming the wrong tests, re-working programmed tests, deciphering different coding styles
    in the programming of the tests, etc.
</p>
<h3>
    Recorded versus programmed scripts
</h3>
<p>
    Although there are clear benefits to recorded scripts (for example, ease of creation or ability for novice testers to
    learn a scripting language), recorded scripts also present their own problems. The disadvantages of playback scripts
    are well known. They are deceptively easy to create but very difficult to update. Problems with script reliability,
    hard-coded data values, or changes to the application under test and the need to re-record are well-documented. On the
    other hand, programming scripts can present difficulties of their own: they are difficult for the novice tester to
    create, they can require substantial time and effort to develop, and they can be difficult to debug. Most test tooling
    makes these issues less problematic by providing the tester script support functions, such as ways to establish target
    of test lists, systematic ways to program verification point, point to datapools, build commands into the script (for
    example, sleeper commands), comment the script, and document the script. Another major advantage, which is often
    overlooked, of using testing tooling to mitigate these risks is the ability to add to an existing script in the form of
    making corrections to an existing script, testing new features of a test target or application under test, or resuming
    a recording after an interruption.
</p>
<h3>
    Functional and performance test scripts
</h3>
<p>
    When discussing automating test scripts, it is important to distinguish between functional and performance tests. Most
    discussions of programming automated test scripts focus on testing the functionality of an application. This is not
    inappropriate, since a lot of automated testing focuses on functional testing. Performance test scripting, however, has
    its unique characteristics. Performance test automation provides you with the ability to programmatically set workloads
    by adding user groups to test loads under group usage, setting think time behavior, running tests randomly or at set
    rates, or setting the duration of a run. Performance test automation also allows you to create and maintain schedules
    for your tests.
</p>
<h3>
    Testing test scripts
</h3>
<p>
    When testing your test scripts, keep in mind whether you are testing recorded or programmed test scripts. For recorded
    scripts, much of the debugging of the script consists of errors that are introduced due to changes in the test target
    or test environment. When you run a recorded test script, consider the test target of the script. Some test automation
    tools capture this information as a part of the test script. Debugging a recorded script consists largely of
    determining whether changes in the target have created error conditions in the script. In general, there are two main
    categories to examine here: changes in the UI and test session sensitive data (for example, date stamped data). In most
    cases, discrepancies between recording and playback cause errors in your recorded test scripts.
</p>
<p>
    Testing programmed test scripts involves many of the same debugging techniques you would apply to debugging an
    application. Consider both the flow control logic and the data aspects of your script. Automated testing tools provide
    you with test script debugging IDEs as well as datapool management features that facilitate this type of testing.
    During execution of test scripts, a test that uses a datapool can replace values in the programmed test with variable
    test data that is stored in the datapool.

    Introduction
</h3>
<p>
    Test ideas are used to generate tests.&nbsp;Test ideas can come from many different sources.&nbsp;In general, they can
    be derived in different ways depending on the given development domain, the kind of application being developed, and
    the sophistication of the testers.&nbsp;Although test ideas are derived in many different ways, there are some useful
    categories for generating them.&nbsp;This guideline will describe some of these categories as well as some general
    heuristics for creating good test ideas.
</p>
<h4>
    Test Ideas and Functions
</h4>
<p>
    Below are some test ideas to calculate the square root:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        A number that's barely less than zero as input
    </li>
    <li>
        Zero as the input
    </li>
    <li>
        Number that's a perfect square, like 4 or 16 (is the result exactly 2 or 4?)
    </li>
    <li>
        Print to a LaserJet IIIp
    </li>
    <li>
        Test with database full
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    The first&nbsp;3 test ideas validate input while the last 2 address environmental issues.&nbsp; Even though these
    statements are very incomplete they ensure that an idea is not forgotten.
</p>
<h4>
    Test Ideas and Boundaries
</h4>
<p>
    Test ideas are often based on fault models.&nbsp; Consider boundaries. It's safe to assume the square root function can
    be implemented something like this:<br />
    <!-- START NON-TRANSLATABLE -->
    double sqrt(double x) {<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (x &lt; 0)<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // signal error<br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...<br />
    <!-- END NON-TRANSLATABLE -->
    It's also plausible that the &lt; will be incorrectly typed as &lt;=. People often make that kind of mistake, so it's
    worth checking. The fault cannot be detected with X having the value 2, because both the incorrect expression (x&lt;=0)
    and the correct expression (x&lt;0) will take the same branch of the if statement. Similarly, giving X the value -5
    cannot find the fault. The only way to find it is to give X the value 0, which justifies the second test idea.
</p>
<h4>
    Test Idea and Methods
</h4>
<p>
    Let's suppose you're designing tests for a method that searches for a string in a sequential collection. It can either
    obey case or ignore case in its search, and it returns the index of the first match found or -1 if no match is
    found.<br />
    int Collection.find(String string, Boolean ignoreCase);
</p>
<p>
    Here are some test ideas for this method, each of which could be implemented as a test.&nbsp;
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Match found in the first position
    </li>
    <li>
        Match found in the last position
    </li>
    <li>
        No match found
    </li>
    <li>
        Two or more matches found in the collection
    </li>
    <li>
        Case is ignored; match found, but it wouldn't match if case was obeyed
    </li>
    <li>
        Case is obeyed; an exact match is found
    </li>
    <li>
        Case is obeyed; a string that would have matched if case were ignored is skipped
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    However, different test ideas can be combined into a single test; for example, the following test satisfies test ideas
    2, 6, and 7:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Setup:</strong> Collection initialized to ["dawn", "Dawn"]<br />
    <strong>Invocation:</strong> Collection.find("Dawn", false)<br />
    <strong>Expected result:</strong> Return value is 1 (it would be 0 if "dawn" were not skipped)
</p>
<h4>
    Test Idea Simplicity and Complexity
</h4>
<p>
    Making test ideas nonspecific makes them easier to combine.<br />
    Creating many several small tests that satisfy a few test ideas makes it simpler to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        "Copy and Tweak" the tests to meet other test idea
    </li>
    <li>
        Easy of debugging - if you have test that covers 2 test ideas then you know the fault is one or two area, but if
        the test covers 7 test ideas you will spend more time debugging the issue.&nbsp;
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    If the test ideas list were complete, with a test idea for every fault in the program, it wouldn't matter how you wrote
    the tests. But the list is always missing some test ideas that could find bugs. Smaller more complex tests increase the
    chance the test will satisfy a test idea that you didn't know you needed.
</p>
<h4>
    Complex Tests
</h4>
<p>
    Sometimes when you're creating more complex tests, new test ideas come to mind. However, there are reasons for not
    creating complex tests.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Complex test are more difficult to debug because they usually cover multiple test ideas
    </li>
    <li>
        Complex tests are more difficult to understand and maintain. The intent of the test is less obvious.
    </li>
    <li>
        Complex tests are more difficult to create.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Constructing a test that satisfies five test ideas often takes more time than constructing five tests that each
    satisfies one. Moreover, it's easier to make mistakes - to think you're satisfying all five when you're only satisfying
    four.<br />
    In practice, find a reasonable balance between complexity and simplicity.<br />

            <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h3>
    Introduction
</h3>
<p>
    The test suite provides a means of managing the complexity of the test implementation. Many system test efforts fail
    because the team gets lost in the minutia of all of the detailed tests, and subsequently loses control of the test
    effort. Similar to UML packages, test suites provide a hierarchy of encapsulating containers to help manage the test
    implementation. They provide a means of managing the strategic aspects of the test effort by collecting tests together
    in related groups that can be planned, managed, and assessed in a meaningful way.
</p>
<p>
    The test suite represents a container for organizing arbitrary collections of related test scripts. This may be
    realized (implemented) as one or more automated regression test suites, but the test suite can also be a work plan for
    the implementation of a group of related manual test scripts. Note also that test suites can be nested hierarchically,
    therefore one test suite may be enclosed within another.
</p>
<p>
    Sometimes these groups of tests will relate directly to a subsystem or other system design element, but other times
    they'll relate directly to things such as quality dimensions, core "mission critical" functions, requirements
    compliance, standards adherence, and many others concerns that are organized based on requirements and therefore cut
    across the internal system elements.
</p>
<p>
    Consider creating test suites that arrange the available test scripts, in addition to other test suites, in many
    different combinations: the more variations you have, the more you'll increase coverage and the potential for finding
    errors. Give thought to a variety of test suites that will cover the breadth and depth of the target test items.
    Remember the corresponding implication that a single test script (or test suite) may appear in many different test
    suites.
</p>
<p>
    Some test automation tools provide the ability to automatically generate or assemble test suites. There are also
    implementation techniques that enable automated test suites to dynamically select all or part of their component test
    scripts for each test cycle run.
</p>
<p>
    Test suites can help you maintain your test assets and impose a level of organization that facilitates the entire
    testing effort.&nbsp; Like physical objects, tests can break. It's not that they wear down, it's that something changed
    in their environment. Perhaps they've been ported to a new operating system. Or, more likely, the code they exercise
    has changed in a way that correctly causes the test to fail. Suppose you're working on version 2.0 of an e-banking
    application. In version 1.0, this method was used to log in:
</p>
<p class="codeSample">
    public boolean login (String username);
</p>
<p>
    In version 2.0, the marketing department has realized that password protection might be a good idea. So the method is
    changed to this:
</p>
<p class="codeSample">
    public boolean login (String username, String password);
</p>
<p>
    Any test that uses the first form of the login will fail. It won't even compile. In this example you could find that,
    not many useful tests can be written that don't use login. You might be faced with hundreds or thousands of failing
    tests.
</p>
<p>
    These tests can be fixed by using a global search-and-replace tool that finds every instance of login(something) and
    replaces it with login(something, "dummy password"). Then arrange for all the testing accounts to use that password,
    and you're on your way.
</p>
<p>
    Then, when marketing decides that passwords should not be allowed to contain spaces, you get to do it all over again.
</p>
<p>
    This kind of thing is a wasteful burden, especially when, as is often the case, the test changes aren't so easily made.
    There is a better way.
</p>
<p>
    Suppose that the test scripts originally did not call the product's login method. Rather, they called a library method
    that does whatever it takes to get the test logged in and ready to proceed. Initially, that method might look like
    this:
</p>
<p class="codeSample">
    public boolean testLogin (String username) {<br />
    &nbsp; return product.login(username);<br />
    }
</p>
<p>
    When the version 2.0 change happens, the utility library is changed to match:
</p>
<p class="codeSample">
    public Boolean testLogin (String username) {<br />
    &nbsp; return product.login(username, "dummy password");<br />
    }
</p>
<p>
    Instead of a changing a thousand tests, you change one method.
</p>
<p>
    Ideally, all the needed library methods would be available at the beginning of the testing effort. In practice, they
    can't all be anticipated-you might not realize you need a testLogin utility method until the first time the product
    login changes. So test utility methods are often "factored out" of existing tests as needed. It is very important that
    you perform this ongoing test repair, even under schedule pressure. If you do not, you will waste much time dealing
    with an ugly and un-maintainable test suite. You might well find yourself throwing it away, or being unable to write
    the needed numbers of new tests because all your available testing time is spent maintaining old ones.
</p>
<p>
    Note: the tests of the product's login method will still call it directly. If its behavior changes, some or all of
    those tests will need to be updated. (If none of the login tests fail when its behavior changes, they're probably not
    very good at detecting defects.)
</p>
<h3>
    Abstraction helps manage complexity
</h3>
<p>
    The previous example showed how tests can abstract away from the concrete application. Most likely you can do
    considerably more abstraction. You might find that a number of tests begin with a common sequence of method calls: they
    log in, set up some state, and navigate to the part of the application you're testing. Only then does each test do
    something different. All this setup could-and should-be contained in a single method with an evocative name such as
    readyAccountForWireTransfer. By doing that, you're saving considerable time when new tests of a particular type are
    written, and you're also making the intent of each test much more understandable.
</p>
<p>
    Understandable tests are important. A common problem with old test suites is that no one knows what the tests are doing
    or why. When they break, the tendency is to fix them in the simplest possible way. That often results in tests that are
    weaker at finding defects. They no longer test what they were originally intended to test.
</p>
<h3>
    Throwing away tests
</h3>
<p>
    Even with utility libraries, a test might periodically be broken by behavior changes that have nothing to do with what
    it checks. Fixing the test doesn't stand much of a chance of finding a defect due to the change; it's something you do
    to preserve the chance of the test finding some other defect someday. But the cost of such a series of fixes might
    exceed the value of the tests hypothetically finding a defect. It might be better to simply throw the test away and
    devote the effort to creating new tests with greater value.
</p>
<p>
    Most people resist the notion of throwing away a test, at least until they're so overwhelmed by the maintenance burden
    that they throw all the tests away. It is better to make the decision carefully and continuously, test by test, asking:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        How much work will it be to fix this test well, perhaps adding to the utility library?
    </li>
    <li>
        How else might the time be used?
    </li>
    <li>
        How likely is it that the test will find serious defects in the future? What's been the track record of it and
        related tests?
    </li>
    <li>
        How long will it be before the test breaks again?
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The answers to these questions will be rough estimates or even guesses. But asking them will yield better results than
    simply having a policy of fixing all tests.
</p>
<p>
    Another reason to throw away tests is that they are now redundant. For example, early in development, there might be a
    multitude of simple tests of basic parse-tree construction methods (the LessOp constructor and the like). Later, during
    the writing of the parser, there will be a number of parser tests. Since the parser uses the construction methods, the
    parser tests will also indirectly test them. As code changes break the construction tests, it's reasonable to discard
    some of them as being redundant. Of course, any new or changed construction behavior will need new tests. They might be
    implemented directly (if they're hard to test thoroughly through the parser) or indirectly (if tests through the parser
    are adequate and more maintainable).

    The cost of correcting errors increases exponentially throughout the development lifecycle <a
    class="elementLinkWithUserText"
    href="./../../../core.tech.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.tech_6CCF393.html"
    guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">[BOE88]</a>. Therefore, it is important to discover problems early enough to solve them
    quickly and inexpensively.
</p>
<p>
    Requirements reviews are intended to discover problems with the <a class="elementLink"
    href="./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/requirements_8006414F.html"
    guid="_0Wh-sMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Requirements</a>&nbsp;before you spend significant time and work in implementing the
    wrong thing. This is not to say that you must have a complete set of requirements before implementation, but be sure to
    review, internally and with stakeholders, those that are selected for implementation in the early iterations and those
    that will have a broad impact on the system (often called <a class="elementLink"
    href="./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/arch_significant_requirements_1EE5D757.html"
    guid="_HrZGIA4MEduibvKwrGxWxA">Architecturally Significant Requirements</a>) to ensure everyone's concurrence before
    investing significant effort in implementation.
</p>
<h3>
    Informal reviews
</h3>
<p>
    Requirements reviews can be informal, such as simply showing draft requirements to your colleagues or demonstrating a
    prototype.
</p>
<p>
    These informal reviews are excellent for getting the structure of the requirements correct and removing obvious
    mistakes. By keeping the review team small, it is easier to make rapid progress. However, informal reviews can miss
    important perspectives&nbsp;of&nbsp;critical stakeholders.
</p>
<h3>
    Formal reviews
</h3>
<p>
    Requirement reviews can be formal meetings. Start with careful preparation, so that you receive and organize comments
    before the meeting. The meeting itself should produce decisions on all review items. After the meeting, you must pursue
    the review actions to completion. If these actions involve a substantial amount of work or require a change to an
    artifact that is under configuration control, consider submitting change requests to prioritize and track the work.
</p>
<p>
    Formal reviews are more wide-ranging and expensive. They provide for more balanced reviews from multiple
    perspectives.&nbsp; However, formal reviews involve more people, which makes them more difficult to coordinate (thus
    the need for formality) and expensive in terms of work hours.
</p>
<h3>
    Two-tier reviews
</h3>
<p>
    One technique to get the best of both worlds is to use staged, or "two-tier", reviews&nbsp;<a
    class="elementLinkWithUserText"
    href="./../../../core.tech.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.tech_6CCF393.html"
    guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">[ADO03]</a>. The&nbsp;first tier is informal and performed by a smaller team, possibly
    many times. The second&nbsp;tier is more formal and performed by the complete group, perhaps only once.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>First-tier review:</strong> The authors of the requirements and the development team&nbsp;review the
    requirements during the first-tier reviews to ensure that they are&nbsp;unambiguous, complete,&nbsp;correct and
    consistent.&nbsp; It is important to include testers and developers to ensure that the requirements are verifiable and
    feasible.&nbsp;These reviews&nbsp;determine whether the requirements are ready for the larger community to
    review.&nbsp; First-tier reviews may be informal, formal, or a combination of the two.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Second-tier review:</strong> Involve the larger group&nbsp;during the higher-tier review to get more minds
    working on the problem and to achieve concurrence that the requirements are suitable for implementation and validation.
</p>
<p>
    At both stages, the checklists for the requirements work products are helpful.
</p>
<p>
    Tiered reviews offer several benefits:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Eliminate the noise caused by minor edits during the first-tier reviews, allowing subsequent reviews to focus on
        functionality
    </li>
    <li>
        Provide a professional look to the requirements, presenting both the requirements and their authors in the best
        possible light
    </li>
    <li>
        Safeguard the time of stakeholders who are reviewing the requirements, thus preventing "review burnout", or
        diminished effectiveness from overload and stress
    </li>
    <li>
        Provide the best opportunity for full, effective reviews.
    </li>
</ol>
<h3>

            <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h3>
    Sources of Requirements
</h3>
<p>
    Good requirements start with good sources. Finding those quality sources is an important task and, fortunately, one
    that&nbsp;takes few&nbsp;resources. Examples of sources of requirements include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Customers
    </li>
    <li>
        Users
    </li>
    <li>
        Administrators and maintenance&nbsp;staff
    </li>
    <li>
        Partners
    </li>
    <li>
        Domain Experts
    </li>
    <li>
        Industry Analysts
    </li>
    <li>
        Information about competitors&nbsp;
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Requirements Gathering Techniques
</h3>
<p>
    After you have identified these sources, there are a number of techniques that may be used to gather requirements. The
    following will describe the various techniques, followed by a brief discussion of when to use each technique.
</p>
<p>
    To get the requirements down on paper, you&nbsp;can to do one or more of the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Conduct a brainstorming session
    </li>
    <li>
        Interview users
    </li>
    <li>
        Send questionnaires
    </li>
    <li>
        Work in the target environment
    </li>
    <li>
        Study analogous systems
    </li>
    <li>
        Examine suggestions and problem reports
    </li>
    <li>
        Talk to support teams
    </li>
    <li>
        Study improvements made by users
    </li>
    <li>
        Look at unintended uses
    </li>
    <li>
        Conduct workshops
    </li>
    <li>
        Demonstrate prototypes to stakeholders
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The best idea is to get the requirements down quickly and then to encourage the users to correct and improve them. Put
    in those corrections, and repeat the cycle. Do it now, keep it small, and correct it at once. Start off with the best
    structure you can devise, but expect to keep on correcting it throughout the process.&nbsp; Success tips: Do it now,
    keep it small, and correct it immediately.
</p>
<h4>
    Conduct a brainstorming session
</h4>
<p>
    Brainstorming is a short group session where everyone is allowed to say whatever they feel is important to the topic of
    discussion. After that, a facilitator leads the group in organizing and prioritizing the results.&nbsp; The following
    basic rules for brainstorming&nbsp;ensures better results:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Start out by clearly stating the objective of the brainstorming session.
    </li>
    <li>
        Generate as may ideas as possible.
    </li>
    <li>
        Let your imagination soar.
    </li>
    <li>
        Do not allow criticism or debate while you are gathering information.
    </li>
    <li>
        Once information is gathered,&nbsp;reshape and combine ideas.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Interview users
</h4>
<p>
    Face-to-face contact with users through individual interviewing is the primary source of requirements and an important
    way you gather and validate their requirements. Remember that it is not the only possible technique, and that you can
    conduct interviews many different ways. Develop a repertoire of styles to&nbsp;fit different situations. Unless you use
    the system yourself, you will need to make an effort to understand and experience the user's problem to describe it
    clearly and correctly.
</p>
<h4>
    Send Questionnaires
</h4>
<p>
    If face-to-face meetings are possible, they are always preferable, because they provide a better means of uncovering
    the problem behind the problem. Sometimes, though,&nbsp;face-to-face meetings with stakeholders are not feasible (when
    developing products for the consumer market, for example). In those situations, consider using questionnaires.&nbsp;
    Send a set of questions, possibly with multiple choice responses, to the relevant stakeholders, and ask them to
    complete it and return it to you.&nbsp; Success&nbsp;tips: Keep it short and given them a deadline.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    This technique has the advantage of providing a lot of information for statistical analysis. However, the questions
    must be well designed to be clear and to avoid so-called "leading questions", which bias the responses.&nbsp;
</p>
<h4>
    Work in the target environment
</h4>
<p>
    Experience the work of the users for yourself. Working with users helps you understand problems that have resisted
    previous solutions. Familiar systems developed in this way inevitably include tools for programmers, such as
    interactive editors and compilers, as the developers naturally have both the expertise in the subject area, and the
    desire to solve their own problems. It would be good to see the same dedication devoted to solving problems in other
    areas too. Where the work cannot easily be experienced in this way, it may still be possible to do a bit more than just
    sit quietly and observe. Users can give you a commentary on what they are doing, what the problems are, and what they
    would like to have to make the work easier.
</p>
<h4>
    Study analogous systems
</h4>
<p>
    The starting point for many projects is often a similar or an existing system. Sometimes, comparable products and
    systems contain working versions of good ideas for solving user problems. You can save the time lost in reinventing the
    wheel by looking at systems already on the market, whether they are systems installed at the user's site or products
    made by rival organizations. Even if they are trying to solve slightly different problems, they often&nbsp;provide
    valuable clues as to what you need to do.
</p>
<p>
    Listen when a customer asks why a product couldn't do something that the customer wants, and keep a list of these
    suggestions. Later, use it to start discussions with other users. You should be able to obtain some requirements
    directly this way. If not, capture and store suggestions for future use.
</p>
<p>
    You can describe to users selected features of other products. Explain that the system is designed for&nbsp;another
    purpose&nbsp;but contains an interesting feature, and you wonder it or something similar&nbsp;would help them.
    Sometimes these systems are described in documents, such as a contract from another organization or a report written
    for management. Often, these documents were never intended as formal requirements, and were written merely to
    communicate a stream-of-consciousness idea. Define a process of going from disorganized to organized information.
</p>
<p>
    Such a process might involve the following activities:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Read the document from end to end (several times) to comprehend what the customer wants and what actually has been
        written.
    </li>
    <li>
        Classify all of the types of information in the document. (user, system requirements, design elements, plans,
        background material, irrelevant detail)
    </li>
    <li>
        Mark up the original text to separate out such requirements.
    </li>
    <li>
        Find a good structure for each of the different types of information such as: a scenario for the user requirements,
        functional breakdown for the system requirements, and architecture for the design.
    </li>
    <li>
        Organize the information to show gaps and overlaps. Feel free to add missing elements, but confirm these decisions
        with the users.
    </li>
    <li>
        Create traceability links between these information elements to show the designers exactly what the users want.
    </li>
    <li>
        Convince the customer to accept the new information as the basis for the contract.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Examine suggestions and problem reports
</h4>
<p>
    Requirements can come from change suggestions and user problems. A direct road to finding requirements is to look at
    suggestions and problems as first described. Most organizations have a form for reporting system problems or software
    defects. You can ask to look through the reports (and there will probably be many). Sort them into groups so you can
    identify the key areas that are troubling users. Ask users some questions about these areas to clarify the users'
    actual needs.
</p>
<h4>
    Talk to support teams
</h4>
<p>
    Most large sales organizations have a help desk that keeps a log of problems and fixes, and support engineers who do
    the fixing. Many organizations have similar facilities to support their own operations. Talking to the help desk staff
    and the support engineers may give you good leads into the requirements, and save you time. Also talk to the training
    team and installation teams about what users find to be&nbsp;difficult.
</p>
<h4>
    Study improvements made by users
</h4>
<p>
    This is an excellent source of requirements. Users of a standard company spreadsheet may have added a few fields, or
    related different sheets together, or drawn a graph, that exactly meets their individual needs. You need only ask: Why
    did you add that? Their answers help you&nbsp;get to the heart of the actual requirement. This applies also to hardware
    and non-computer devices. For example, a lathe operator may have manufactured a special clamp, or an arm that prevents
    movement of the tool beyond a certain point. Any such modification points to something wrong with the existing product,
    which makes it&nbsp;a valid&nbsp;requirement for the new version.
</p>
<h4>
    Look at unintended uses
</h4>
<p>
    People often use things for purposes for which they were not designed.&nbsp; This is&nbsp;a good way to get new ideas
    and to think of innovations. For example, an observant product manager noticed that an engineer was staying in the
    office late to use an advanced computer-aided design system to design a new kitchen layout for his home. Inexpensive
    commercial products are now widely available for home use.
</p>
<h4>
    Conduct workshops
</h4>
<p>
    Workshops can rapidly pull together a good set of requirements. In two to five days, you can create a set of
    requirements, and then review and improve them. If everyone in a workshop tries to estimate the cost and value of each
    requirement, the document becomes much more useful and cost-effective.
</p>
<p>
    Workshops are quicker and better at discovering requirements than other techniques, such as sending questionnaires. You
    are bringing the right collection of people together, and getting them to correct and improve on their requirements
    document.
</p>
<p>
    A workshop is inherently expensive because of the number of people involved, but it saves a large amount of time. If
    you can define the product right the first time and cut three months off the requirements gathering, the savings could
    be enormous. The workshop has to be thoroughly organized to take advantage of people's time.
</p>
<p>
    Choose a quiet location for the workshop so that people are not disturbed by day-to-day business. Mobile phones should
    be discouraged; arrange to take messages externally. Take advantage of informal interactions by choosing a site so that
    people don't go home at night or go out separately. The example&nbsp;in Figure 1&nbsp;shows the logic of a requirements
    workshop. Note that the workshop provides the environment in which to apply other requirements-gathering techniques
    such as brainstorming.

    <strong>Figure 1: Conducting Workshops</strong>
</p>
<h4>
    Demonstrate prototypes to stakeholders
</h4>
<p>
    Prototypes allow us to immediately see some aspects of the system. Showing users a simple prototype can
    provoke&nbsp;them into giving good requirements information or changing their mind about existing requirements. The
    techniques described here help you gather ideas for requirements. Prototypes and models are an excellent way of
    presenting ideas to users. They can illustrate how an approach might work, or give users a glimpse of what they might
    be able to do. More requirements are likely to emerge when users see what you are suggesting.
</p>
<p>
    A presentation can use a sequence of slides, storyboard, an artist's impression, or even an animation to give users a
    vision of the possibilities. When prototyping software, make a mock-up of the user interface screens, emphasizing that
    there is no code and that the system has not been designed or even specified yet (fair warning: there are dangers here
    for the unwary).
</p>
<p>
    This prototyping aims to get users to express (missing) requirements. You are not trying to sell users an idea or
    product, you are finding out what they actually want. Seeing a prototype, which invariably is wrong in some ways and
    right in others, is a powerful stimulus to users to start saying what they want. They may point out plenty of problems
    with the prototype! This is excellent,&nbsp;because each problem leads to a new requirement.
</p>
<h3>
    Which Technique to Apply?
</h3>
<p>
    Which technique to apply depends on a number of factors, such as:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Availability and location of stakeholders
    </li>
    <li>
        Development team knowledge of the problem domain
    </li>
    <li>
        Customers' and users' knowledge of the problem domain
    </li>
    <li>
        Customers' and users' knowledge of the development process and methods
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    If the stakeholders are not co-located or readily available, for example in the case of a product being developed for
    mass market,&nbsp;techniques such as brainstorming, interviews and workshops that require face-to-face contact with the
    stakeholders may be difficult or impossible.
</p>
<p>
    If the stakeholders are available for face-to-face meetings, this is a much better situation and almost all of the
    techniques described, or combination of them, may be applied. In this case, the domain and development experience of
    both the stakeholders and the development team are critical factors in selecting the appropriate technique.
</p>

<h4>
    Avoid ambiguity.
</h4>
<p>
    Avoidance of ambiguity is one of the subtlest and most difficult issues in writing requirements. Try to write as
    clearly and explicitly as possible. Be specific. Remember, though, that if you carry this too far, the text becomes
    dull and unreadable, which makes it difficult for other people to review. Although this guideline emphasizes
    structured, written expression of requirements, informal text, diagrams, conversations, and phone calls are excellent
    ways of removing ambiguity.
</p>
<p>
    Some constructions (such as the use of or and unless in requirements) allow different groups of readers to understand
    different things from the same wording. Developers could use this technique deliberately, so as to postpone, until too
    late, any possibility of the customer's asking for what was truly wanted. This is dangerous and could easily backfire.
</p>
<p>
    The only approach that works is for developers to make requirements as clear as possible, and for all stakeholders to
    co-operate. In the long run, project success is in everybody's interest.
</p>
<p>
    Dangerous ambiguities can be caused by the word <strong>or</strong> and also by many more-subtle errors.
</p>
<h5>
    Example
</h5>
<p>
    <em>The same subsystem shall also be able to generate a visible or audible caution/warning signal for the attention of
    the co-pilot or navigator.</em>
</p>
<p>
    Which subsystem? Is the signal to be visible, audible, or both? Is it both caution and warning, just caution, or just
    warning? Is it for both the co-pilot and the navigator, or just one of them? If just one of them, which one and under
    what conditions?
</p>
<h4>
    Don't make multiple requirements.
</h4>
<p>
    Requirements which contain conjunctions (words that join independent clauses together) are dangerous. Problems arise
    when readers try to figure out which part applies, especially if the different clauses seem to conflict, or if the
    individual parts apply separately. Multiple requirements also make verification more complex.
</p>
<p>
    Dangerous conjunctions include: and, or, but.
</p>
<h5>
    Example
</h5>
<p>
    <em>The battery low warning lamp shall light up when the voltage drops below 3.6 Volts, and the current workspace or
    input data shall be saved.</em>
</p>
<p>
    Should the battery low warning lamp light up when the voltage drops and the workspace is saved? Should the battery low
    warning lamp light up and the workspace be saved when the voltage drops?
</p>
<h4>
    Never use let-out or escape words
</h4>
<p>
    Requirements that include options or exceptions are dangerous. They seem to ask for something definite, but at the last
    moment they back down and allow for other options. Problems arise when the requirements are to be tested, and someone
    has to decide what (if anything) could prove the requirement was met.
</p>
<p>
    Dangerous words that imply exceptions include: if, when, but, except, unless, although.
</p>
<h5>
    Examples
</h5>
<p>
    <em>The forward passenger doors shall open automatically when the aircraft has halted, except when the rear ramp is
    deployed.</em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>The fire alarm shall always be sounded when smoke is detected, unless the alarm is being tested or the engineer has
    suppressed the alarm.</em>
</p>
<p>
    The latter sentence is a truly dangerous requirement!
</p>
<h4>
    Don't ramble.
</h4>
<p>
    Long rambling sentences, especially when combined with arcane language, references to unreachable documents, and other
    defects of writing, quickly lead to confusion and error.
</p>
<h5>
    Example
</h5>
<p>
    <em>Provided that the designated input signals from the specified devices are received in the correct order where the
    system is able to differentiate the designators, the output signal shall comply with the required framework of section
    3.1.5 to indicate the desired input state.</em>
</p>
<h4>
    Resist designing the system
</h4>
<p>
    Requirements should specify the design envelope without unnecessary constraints on a specific design. If we supply too
    much detail we start to design the system. Going too far is tempting for designers, especially when they come to their
    favorite bits.
</p>
<p>
    Danger signs include names of components, materials, software objects/procedures, and database fields.
</p>
<h5>
    Example
</h5>
<p>
    <em>The antenna shall be capable of receiving FM signals, using a copper core with nylon covering and a waterproof
    hardened rubber shield.</em>
</p>
<p>
    Specifying design rather than actual need increases the cost of systems by placing needless constraints on development
    and manufacture. Often knowing why is much better than knowing what.
</p>
<h4>
    Avoid mixing different kinds of requirements
</h4>
<p>
    The user requirements form a complete model of what users want. They need to be organized coherently to show gaps and
    overlaps. The same applies to system requirements, which form a complete functional model of the proposed system. A
    quick road to confusion is to mix up requirements for users, systems, and how the system should be designed, tested, or
    installed.
</p>
<p>
    Danger signs are any references to system, design, testing, or installation.
</p>
<h5>
    Example
</h5>
<p>
    <em>The user shall be able to view the currently selected channel number which shall be displayed in 14pt Swiss type on
    an LCD panel tested to Federal Regulation Standard 567-89 and mounted with shockproof rubber washers.</em>
</p>
<h4>
    Do not speculate.
</h4>
<p>
    Requirements are part of a contract between customer and developer. There is no room for wish lists, meaning general
    terms about things that somebody probably wants.
</p>
<p>
    Danger signs include vagueness about which type of user is speaking, and generalization such as: usually, generally,
    often, normally, typically.
</p>
<h5>
    Example
</h5>
<p>
    <em>Users normally require early indication of intrusion into the system.</em>
</p>
<h4>
    Do not use vague, undefined terms
</h4>
<p>
    Many words used informally to indicate system quality are too vague for use in requirements. Vague terms include, among
    others: user-friendly, versatile, flexible, approximately, as possible.
</p>
<p>
    Requirements using these terms are unverifiable because there is no definite test to show whether the system has the
    indicated property.
</p>
<h5>
    Examples
</h5>
<p>
    <em>The print dialog shall be versatile and user-friendly.</em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>The OK status indicator lamp shall be illuminated as soon as possible after the system self-check is
    completed.</em>
</p>
<h4>
    Do not express possibilities.
</h4>
<p>
    Suggestions that are not explicitly stated as requirements are invariably ignored by developers.
</p>
<p>
    "Possible options" are indicated with terms such as: may, might, should, ought, could, perhaps, probably
</p>
<h5>
    Example
</h5>
<p>
    <em>The reception subsystem probably ought to be powerful enough to receive a signal inside a steel-framed
    building.</em>
</p>
<h4>
    Avoid wishful thinking.
</h4>
<p>
    Engineering is a real-world activity. No system or component is perfect. Wishful thinking means asking for the
    impossible.
</p>
<p>
    Wishful-thinking terms include: reliable, safe, handle all unexpected failures, please all users, run on all platforms,
    never fail, upgradeable to all future situations.
</p>
<h5>
    Examples
</h5>
<p>
    <em>The gearbox shall be 100% safe in normal operation.</em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>The network shall handle all unexpected errors without crashing.</em>

            <MainDescription><![CDATA[<p>
    To write a good requirement, you must write it as a complete sentence, with a subject and a predicate (usually a verb).
    The subject&nbsp;is an Actor, a stakeholder, the system under development, or a design entity that is related to the
    requirement. The predicate specifies a condition, action, or intended result that is done for, by, with, or to the
    subject.
</p>
<p>
    Consistent use of the verb <strong>to be</strong> solidifies the link between the subject and the predicate. Thus, you
    can analyze a requirement from a grammatical point of view.
</p>
<p>
    Beware of lists, bullets, and words such as <strong>all</strong>, <strong>every</strong>, and <strong>some</strong>.
    For example:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        The order entry clerk must be able to complete 10 customer orders in less than two hours.
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    This requirement has a subject (the order entry clerk, who is an Actor), a specific and measurable end state (10
    customer orders completed), and a performance criterion (in less than two hours).
</p>
<p>
    Follow these simple guidelines in writing any requirement. For consistency, these examples are all in the context of an
    aircraft. [[WAS: is used throughout.]] <a class="elementlinkwithusertext"

    Requirements are the project team's to-do list.
</p>
<p>
    Requirements define what is needed and focus the project team. They are the primary method used to communicate the
    goals of the project to everyone on the team.
</p>
<p>
    Requirements define:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        What the stakeholders need; and
    </li>
    <li>
        What the system must include to satisfy the stakeholders' needs.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Requirements are the basis for capturing and communicating needs, managing expectations, prioritizing and assigning
    work, verifying and validating the system (acceptance), and managing the scope of the project.
</p>
<p>
    Requirements may take different forms, including scenarios, unstructured text, structured text, or a combination, and
    they may be stated at different levels of granularity. At the highest level of granularity, features&nbsp;define the
    services that the system must provide to solve the customer's problem. These are captured as structured or unstructured
    text in the project vision. At the next level of granularity, use cases can be used to define the functionality that
    the system must provide to deliver the required features.&nbsp;Use cases&nbsp;describe the sequence of actions
    performed by the system to yield an observable result of value.
</p>
<p>
    As mentioned, a&nbsp;system must perform according to the behavior that can be specified as use cases. However, there
    are system requirements that do not represent a specific behavior, also&nbsp;known as system-wide requirements,
    including:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Legal and regulatory requirements, as well as application standards
    </li>
    <li>
        Quality attributes of the system to be built, including usability, reliability, performance, and supportability
        requirements
    </li>
    <li>
        Interface requirements to be able to communicate with external systems
    </li>
    <li>
        Design constraints, such as those for operating systems and environments and for compatibility with other software

            <MainDescription><![CDATA[<p>
    An Implementation Mechanism is a refinement of a corresponding Design Mechanism that uses, for example, a particular
    programming language and other implementation technology (such as a particular vendor's middleware product). An
    Implementation Mechanism may instantiate one or more idioms or implementation patterns.
</p>
<p>
    Review these points when you are considering Implementation Mechanisms:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            <b>Determine the ranges of characteristics.</b> Take the characteristics that you identified for the Design
            Mechanisms into consideration to determine reasonable, economical, or feasible ranges of values to use in the
            Implementation Mechanism candidate.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <b>Consider the cost of purchased components</b>. For Implementation Mechanism candidates, consider the cost of
            licensing, the maturity of the product, your history or relationship with the vendor, support, and so forth in
            addition to purely technical criteria.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <b>Conduct a search for the right components, or build the components.</b> You will often find that there is no
            apparently suitable Implementation Mechanism for a particular Design Mechanism. This will either trigger a
            search for the right product or make the need for in-house development apparent. You may also find that some
            Implementation Mechanisms are not used at all.<br />
            <br />
            The choice of Implementation Mechanisms is based not only on a good match for the technical characteristics,
            but also on the non-technical characteristics, such as cost. Some of the choices may be provisional. Almost all
            have some risks attached to them. Performance, robustness, and scalability are nearly always concerns and must
            be validated by evaluation, exploratory prototyping, or inclusion in the architectural prototype.

    Using a coding standard is a widely accepted software development practice. The need for this practice takes on added
    importance in a highly collaborative environment. The team should have a standard way of naming and formatting things
    so they can understand the code quickly and know where to look at all times. This enables shared code ownership since
    any team member should be able to quickly understand the code written by others.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Ideally, the coding standard should be the result of team consensus. Involving the team members will aid adoption of
    the standards.
</p>
<p>
    Coding Standards cover such areas as:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Naming standards. This includes the naming of elements all the way down to the smallest variable. In covering
        larger-scale elements, this overlaps into what could be considered design standards.
    </li>
    <li>
        File organization. This includes file naming conventions and how the files will be organized on the file system.
    </li>
    <li>
        Comment standards. Too much emphasis on comments implies a lack of confidence that readable code is being written,
        plus there is always a concern that the comments are not up to date. Yet, a consistent approach to comments
        improves understandability and can support the ability to generate documentation from the code.
    </li>
    <li>
        Coding conventions. Consistent application of specific code-level conventions and the exclusion of some considered
        poor form improve the quality of the code.
    </li>
    <li>
        White space. Though it can be argued to be less critical than the other items listed here, a consistent usage of
        white space as indentation and blank lines also improves readability.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    In some cases, decisions will be arbitrary (like how much to indent). Each item in the standard should support one or
    more goals, improved communication being one of the most critical goals. Once the team agrees on a standard, all
    members of the teams are expected to follow it. With time, the team will use and modify the standard to develop a style
    that is well adapted to the environment.
</p>
<p>
    Though some standards can transcend any language, coding standards must be language specific for the most part.
</p>
<p>
    For example coding standards, see the <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/codeconv/html/CodeConvTOC.doc.html"

            <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h4>
    <a id="Introduction" name="Introduction">Introduction</a>
</h4>
<p>
    Design must define enough of the system so that it can be implemented unambiguously. What constitutes enough varies
    from project to project and company to company.
</p>
<p>
    In some cases the design resembles a sketch, elaborated only far enough to ensure that the implementer can proceed (a
    "sketch and code" approach). The degree of specification varies with the expertise of the implementer, the complexity
    of the design, and the risk that the design might be misconstrued.
</p>
<p>
    In other cases, the design is elaborated to the point that the design can be transformed automatically into code. This
    typically involves extensions to standard UML to represent language and/or environment specific semantics.
</p>
<p>
    The design may also be hierarchical, such as the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        a high level design model which sketches an overview of the overall system
    </li>
    <li>
        a subsystem specification model which precisely specifies the required interfaces and behavior of major subsystems
        within the system
    </li>
    <li>
        a detailed design model for the internals of subsystems
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The sections below describe some different options for relating a design and implementation, and discuss benefits and
    drawbacks of these approaches.
</p>
<h4>
    <a id="sketch" name="sketch">Sketch and Code</a>
</h4>
<p>
    One common approach to design is to sketch out the design at a fairly abstract level, and then move directly to code.
    Maintenance of the design model is manual.
</p>
<p>
    In this approach, we let a design class be an abstraction of several code-level classes. We recommend that you map each
    design class to one "head" class that, in turn, can use several "helper" classes to perform its behavior. You can use
    "helper" classes to implement a complex attribute or to build a data structure that you need for the implementation of
    an operation. In design, you don't model the "helper" classes and you only model the key attributes, relationships, and
    operations defined by the head class. The purpose of such a model is to abstract away details that can be completed by
    the implementer.
</p>
<p>
    This approach is extended to apply to the other design model elements. You may have design interfaces which are more
    abstract than the code-level interfaces, and so on.
</p>
<h4>
    <a id="round" name="round">Round-Trip Engineering</a>
</h4>
<p>
    In round-trip engineering environments, the design model evolves to a level of detail where it becomes a visual
    representation of the code. The code and its visual representation are synchronized (with tool support).
</p>
<p>
    The following are some options for representing a Design Model in a round-trip engineering context.
</p>
<p>
    <b><a id="trace" name="trace">High Level Design Model and Detailed Design Model</a></b>
</p>
<p>
    In this approach, there are two levels of design model maintained. Each high level design element is an abstraction of
    one or more detailed elements in the round-tripped model. For example, a design class may map to one "head" class and
    several "helper" classes, just as in the "sketch and code" approach described previously. Traceability from the high
    level design model elements to round-trip model elements can help maintain consistency between the two models.
</p>
<p>
    Although this can help abstract away less important details, this benefit must be balanced against the effort required
    to maintain consistency between the models.
</p>
<p>
    <b><a id="evolves" name="evolves">Single Evolving Design Model</a></b>
</p>
<p>
    In this approach, there is a single Design Model. Initial sketches of design elements evolve to the point where they
    can be synchronized with code. Diagrams, such as those used to describe design use-case realizations, initially
    reference sketched design classes, but eventually reference language-specific classes. High level descriptions of the
    design are maintained as needed, such as:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        diagrams of the logical structure of the system,
    </li>
    <li>
        subsystem/component specifications,
    </li>
    <li>
        design patterns / mechanisms.<br />
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Such a model is easier to maintain consistent with the implementation.
</p>
<h4>
    <a id="specification" name="specification">Specification and Realization Models</a>
</h4>
<p>
    A related approach is to define the design in terms of specifications for major subsystems, detailed to the point where
    client implementations can compile against them.
</p>
<p>
    The detailed design of the subsystem realization can be modeled and maintained separately from this specification
    model.
</p>
<p>
    Models can be detailed and used to generate an implementation. Both structure (class and package diagrams) and behavior
    diagrams (such as collaboration, state, and activity diagrams) can be used to generate executable code. These initial
    versions can be further refined as needed.
</p>
<p>
    The design may be platform-independent to varying degrees. Platform-specific design models or even code can be
    generated by transformations that apply various rules to map high-level abstractions of platform-specific elements.
    This is the focus of the Object Management Group (OMG) Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) <a href="http://www.omg.org/"
    target="_blank">(http://www.omg.org</a>) initiative.
</p>
<p>
    Platform-specific visual models can be used to generate an initial code framework. This framework can be further
    elaborated with additional code not specified in the design.
</p>
<h4>
    Patterns
</h4>
<p>
    Standard patterns can be applied to generate design and code elements from related design and implementation. For
    example, a standard transformation pattern can be applied to a data table to create Java&trade; classes to access the data
    table. Another example is using an <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/emf/" target="_blank">Eclipse Modeling Framework</a>
    to generate code for storing data that matches the model and to generate a user interface implementation for populating
    data. A pattern or transformation engine can be used to create the implementation, or the implementation can be done by
    hand. Pattern engines are easier and more reliable, but handwritten code implementing a defined pattern will have fewer
    errors than handwritten code implementing a novel or unique design.

            <MainDescription><![CDATA[<p>
    Refactoring involves improving the quality of existing code without changing the system's behavior. It is explicitly
    not about adding or changing behavior, but about improving the implementation quality of existing behavior.
</p>
<p>
    A full set of developer tests is required before refactoring can be safely applied. It is critical that the system
    behavior be in a known, verifiably correct state before modifying the implementation so that you can improve the
    quality without fear that the modified implementation will break something. Refactoring is a safe transformation to
    improve code, but it is safe only if there are tests that can verify that the system still works as intended.
</p>
<p>
    Refactoring is initiated when an area that needs improvement is identified in the system by examining either the code
    or&nbsp;some other&nbsp;representation of the design. The issues identified are sometimes called "smells."
</p>
<p>
    Here are several smells to look for that might lead to implementation or design refactoring:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Duplicated code:</b> Duplicated code makes the system harder to understand and harder to maintain.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Large design element or method:</b> Large design elements or methods diminish the ability of people to
        understand the code, reduce the potential for reuse, and make developer testing more difficult.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Poorly named element:</b> Whether the element be a variable, function, class, or implementation element, its
        name should connote what it is so that the code can be maintained.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Tight coupling:</strong> Each design element should work with minimal concern for the internal aspects of
        other design elements. Otherwise, changes to one element can have undesirable effects in other elements.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    As you can see from this list, refactoring can improve the "internals" of an element or&nbsp;the interface of the
    element. Also, many of the smells&nbsp;are characterized as making the software more difficult to understand; whereas
    refactoring is about making the system simpler.
</p>
<p>
    After an issue is identified, a refactoring method can be selected that will improve the situation. There are catalogs
    of refactoring methods available that are change patterns that will fix common problems while retaining the behavior of
    the system.
</p>
<p>
    These are examples of refactoring methods:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Extract Method:</b> Pull out the duplicated code into its own single method or extract part of a large method
        into its own method.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Extract Class:</b> Pull some cohesive part of a class into its own class to reduce the size of a design element
        that is too big.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Rename Method</b>, <b>Rename Class</b>, or <b>Rename Variable:</b> Give a more meaningful name to an element to
        make it more understandable.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Extract Interface:</b> Create a clean interface.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    After refactoring has been applied, developer tests are run again to ensure that the system still behaves correctly. It
    is important that the system is working correctly after each small refactoring. Although many refactorings can be put
    together to drive broad change across the code base, the tests should run correctly between each refactoring applied.
    Refactoring must be applied as small behavior-preserving transformations.
</p>
<p>
    As mentioned previously, refactoring requires full developer test coverage of the area under consideration. There are
    additional techniques that enable refactoring. Coding standards define a common style and make it easier to refactor
    consistently. An attitude of&nbsp;collective code ownership within the team is important. Each developer should feel
    that refactoring can be applied across the code base to improve the implementation.

    Developer testing is the act of regression testing source code by developers. This is sometimes called "unit regression
    testing" but many developer tests go beyond unit testing to address integration testing as well.
</p>
<h3>
    Testing Philosophies
</h3>
<p>
    Here are some important philosophies with regard to developer testing:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        The goal is to find defects. Successful tests find bugs, but correcting the bugs falls into other areas.
    </li>
    <li>
        Test early and often. The cost of change rises exponentially the longer it takes to find and then remove a defect.
        The implication is that you want to test as early as possible.
    </li>
    <li>
        Testing builds confidence. Many people fear making a change to their code because they are afraid that they will
        break it, but with a full test suite in place if you do break something you know you will detect it and then fix
        it.
    </li>
    <li>
        One test is worth a thousand opinions. You can say that your application works, but until you show the test results
        you might not be believed.
    </li>
    <li>
        Test to the risk. The riskier something is, the more it needs to be reviewed and tested. For example, you should
        invest significantly more&nbsp;effort testing a safety-critical algorithm for measuring radiation doses, and far
        less effort testing the "change font size" function of the same application.
    </li>
    <li>
        You can validate all artifacts. You can test all your artifacts, not just your source code, although the focus of
        this guidance is testing code.
    </li>
</ol>
<h3>
    Qualities of a Good Developer Test
</h3>These are the qualities of a good developer test: 
<ul class="noindent">
    <li>
        It runs fast. It has short setup, run time, and clean-up.
    </li>
    <li>
        It runs in isolation. You should be able to reorder your tests.
    </li>
    <li>
        It is understandable. Good tests have consistent and informative names and use data that makes them easy to read
        and to understand.
    </li>
    <li>
        It uses real data. For example, use copies of production data when appropriate, but remember that you'll typically
        have to create some specific "artificial" test data as well.
    </li>
    <li>
        It is minimally cohesive. The test represents one step toward your overall goal. The test should address one and
        one only issue.
    </li>
</ul>]]></MainDescription>

            <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h3>
    Establish expectations
</h3>
<p>
    Those who find developer testing rewarding do it. Those who view it as a chore find ways to avoid it. This is simply in
    the nature of most developers in most industries, and treating it as a shameful lack of discipline hasn't historically
    been successful. Therefore, as a developer you should expect testing to be rewarding and do what it takes to make it
    rewarding.
</p>
<p>
    Ideal developer testing follows a very tight edit-test loop. You make a small change to the product, such as adding a
    new method to a class, then you immediately rerun your tests. If any test breaks, you know exactly what code is the
    cause. This easy, steady pace of development is the greatest reward of developer testing. A long debugging session
    should be exceptional.
</p>
<p>
    Because it's not unusual for a change made in one class to break something in another, you should expect to rerun not
    just the changed class's tests, but many tests. Ideally, you rerun the complete test suite for your implementation
    element many times per hour. Every time you make a significant change, you rerun the suite, watch the results, and
    either proceed to the next change or fix the last change. Expect to spend some effort making that rapid feedback
    possible.
</p>
<h3>
    Write and maintain&nbsp;tests
</h3>
<h4>
    Automate your tests
</h4>
<p>
    Running tests often is not practical if tests are manual. For some implementation elements, automated tests are easy.
    An example would be an in-memory database. It communicates to its clients through an API and has no other interface to
    the outside world. Tests for it would look something like this:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
<!-- START NON-TRANSLATABLE -->
/* Check that elements can be added at most once. */
// Setup
Database db = new Database();
db.add("key1", "value1");
// Test
boolean result = db.add("key1", "another value");
expect(result == false);
<!-- END NON-TRANSLATABLE -->
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
    The tests are different from ordinary client code in only one way: instead of believing the results of API calls, they
    check. If the API makes client code easy to write, it makes test code easy to write. If the test code is <i>not</i>
    easy to write, you've received an early warning that the API could be improved. Test-first design is thus consistent
    with the iterative processes' focus on addressing important risks early.
</p>
<p>
    The more tightly connected the element is to the outside world, however, the harder it will be to test. There are two
    common cases: graphical user interfaces and back-end components.
</p>
<h5>
    Graphical user interfaces
</h5>
<p>
    Suppose the database in the example above receives its data via a callback from a user-interface object. The callback
    is invoked when the user fills in some text fields and pushes a button. Testing this by manually filling in the fields
    and pushing the button isn't something you want to do many times an hour. You must arrange a way to deliver the input
    under programmatic control, typically by "pushing" the button in code.
</p>
<p>
    Pushing the button causes some code in the implementation element to be executed. Most likely, that code changes the
    state of some user-interface objects. So you must also arrange a way to query those objects programmatically.
</p>
<h5>
    Back-end components
</h5>
<p>
    Suppose the element under test doesn't implement a database. Instead, it's a wrapper around a real, on-disk database.
    Testing against that real database might be difficult. It might be hard to install and configure. Licenses for it might
    be expensive. The database might slow down the tests enough that you're not inclined to run them often. In such cases,
    it's worthwhile to "stub out" the database with a simpler element that does just enough to support the tests.
</p>
<p>
    Stubs are also useful when a component that your element talks to isn't ready yet. You don't want your testing to wait
    on someone else's code.
</p>
<h4>
    Don't write your own tools
</h4>
<p>
    Developer testing seems pretty straightforward. You set up some objects, make a call through an API, check the result,
    and announce a test failure if the results aren't as expected. It's also convenient to have some way to group tests so
    that they can be run individually or as complete suites. Tools that support those requirements are called <i>test
    frameworks</i>.
</p>
<p>
    Developer testing <b>is</b> straightforward, and the requirements for test frameworks are not complicated. If, however,
    you yield to the temptation of writing your own test framework, you'll spend much more time tinkering with the
    framework than you probably expect. There are many test frameworks available, both commercial and open source, and
    there's no reason not to use one of those.
</p>
<h4>
    Do create support code
</h4>
<p>
    Test code tends to be repetitive. It's common to see sequences of code like this:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
<!-- START NON-TRANSLATABLE -->
// null name not allowed
retval = o.createName(""); 
expect(retval == null);
// leading spaces not allowed
retval = o.createName(" l"); 
expect(retval == null);
// trailing spaces not allowed
retval = o.createName("name "); 
expect(retval == null);
// first character may not be numeric
retval = o.createName("5allpha"); 
expect(retval == null);
<!-- END NON-TRANSLATABLE -->
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
    This code is created by copying one check, pasting it, then editing it to make another check.
</p>
<p>
    The danger here is twofold. If the interface changes, much editing will have to be done. (In more complicated cases, a
    simple global replacement won't suffice.) Also, if the code is at all complicated, the intent of the test can be lost
    amid all the text.
</p>
<p>
    When you find yourself repeating yourself, seriously consider factoring out the repetition into support code. Even
    though the code above is a simple example, it's more readable and maintainable if written like this:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
<!-- START NON-TRANSLATABLE -->
void expectNameRejected(MyClass o, String s) {
Object retval = o.createName(s);
expect(retval == null);
}
...
// null name not allowed
expectNameRejected(o, ""); 
// leading spaces not allowed.
expectNameRejected(o, " l"); 
// trailing spaces not allowed.
expectNameRejected(o, "name "); 
// first character may not be numeric.
expectNameRejected(o, "5alpha"); 
<!-- END NON-TRANSLATABLE -->
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
    Developers writing tests often err on the side of too much copying-and-pasting. If you suspect yourself of that
    tendency, it's useful to consciously err in the other direction. Resolve that you will strip your code of all duplicate
    text.
</p>
<h4>
    Keep the tests understandable
</h4>
<p>
    You should expect that you, or someone else, will have to modify the tests later. A typical situation is that a later
    iteration calls for a change to the element's behavior. As a simple example, suppose the element once declared a square
    root method like this:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <font size="+0">double sqrt(double x);</font>
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    In that version, a negative argument caused the function "sqrt" to return NaN ("not a number" from the IEEE 754-1985
    <i>Standard for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic</i>). In the new iteration, the square root method will accept
    negative numbers and return a complex result:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <font size="+0">Complex sqrt(double x);</font>
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    Old tests for the function "sqrt" will have to change. That means understanding what they do, and updating them so that
    they work with the new "sqrt". When updating tests, you must take care not to destroy their bug-finding power. One way
    that sometimes happens is this:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
<!-- START NON-TRANSLATABLE -->
void testSQRT () {
//  Update these tests for Complex 
// when I have time -- bem
/*
double result = sqrt(0.0);
...
*/
}
<!-- END NON-TRANSLATABLE -->
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
    Other ways are more subtle: the tests are changed so that they actually run, but they no longer test what they were
    originally intended to test. The end result, over many iterations, can be a test suite that is too weak to catch many
    bugs. This is sometimes called "test suite decay". A decayed suite will be abandoned, because it's not worth the
    upkeep.
</p>
<p>
    Test suite decay is less likely in the direct tests for the function "sqrt" than in indirect tests. There will be code
    that calls the function "sqrt". That code will have tests. When the function "sqrt" changes, some of those tests will
    fail. The person who changes the function "sqrt" will probably have to change those tests. Because he's less familiar
    with them, and because their relationship to the change is less clear, he's more likely to weaken them in the process
    of making them pass.
</p>
<p>
    When you're creating support code for tests (as urged above), be careful: the support code should clarify, not obscure,
    the purpose of the tests that use it. A common complaint about object-oriented programs is that there's no one place
    where anything's done. If you look at any one method, all you discover is that it forwards its work somewhere else.
    Such a structure has advantages, but it makes it harder for new people to understand the code. Unless they make an
    effort, their changes are likely to be incorrect or to make the code even more complicated and fragile. The same is
    true of test code, except that later maintainers are even less likely to take due care. You must head off the problem
    by writing understandable tests.
</p>
<h4>
    Match the test structure to the product structure
</h4>
<p>
    Suppose someone has inherited your implementation element. They need to change a part of it. They may want to examine
    the old tests to help them in their new design. They want to update the old tests before writing the code (test-first
    design).
</p>
<p>
    All those good intentions will go by the wayside if they can't find the appropriate tests. What they'll do is make the
    change, see what tests fail, then fix those. That will contribute to test suite decay.
</p>
<p>
    For that reason, it's important that the test suite be well structured, and that the location of tests be predictable
    from the structure of the product. Most usually, developers arrange tests in a parallel hierarchy, with one test class
    per product class. So if someone is changing a class named "Log", they know the test class is "TestLog", and they know
    where the source file can be found.
</p>
<h4>
    Let tests violate encapsulation
</h4>
<p>
    You might limit your tests to interacting with your implementation element exactly as client code does, through the
    same interface that client code uses. However, this has disadvantages. Suppose you're testing a simple class that
    maintains a doubly linked list:
</p>
<p>
    In particular, you're testing the "DoublyLinkedList.insertBefore(Object existing, Object newObject)" method. In one of
    your tests, you want to insert an element in the middle of the list, then check if it's been inserted successfully. The
    test uses the list above to create this updated list:
</p>
<p>
    It checks the list correctness like this:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
<!-- START NON-TRANSLATABLE -->
// the list is now one longer. 
expect(list.size()==3);
// the new element is in the correct position
expect(list.get(1)==m);
// check that other elements are still there.
expect(list.get(0)==a);
expect(list.get(2)==z);
<!-- END NON-TRANSLATABLE -->
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
    That seems sufficient, but it's not. Suppose the list implementation is incorrect and backward pointers are not set
    correctly. That is, suppose the updated list actually looks like this:
</p>
<p>
    If the function "DoublyLinkedList.get(int index)" traverses the list from the beginning to the end (likely), the test
    would miss this failure. If the class provides "elementBefore" and "elementAfter" methods, checking for such failures
    is straightforward:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
<!-- START NON-TRANSLATABLE -->
// Check that links were all updated
expect(list.elementAfter(a)==m);
expect(list.elementAfter(m)==z);
expect(list.elementBefore(z)==m); //this will fail
expect(list.elementBefore(m)==a);
<!-- END NON-TRANSLATABLE -->
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
    But what if it doesn't provide those methods? You could devise more elaborate sequences of method calls that will fail
    if the suspected defect is present. For example, this would work:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
<!-- START NON-TRANSLATABLE -->
// Check whether back-link from Z is correct.
list.insertBefore(z, x);
// If it was incorrectly not updated, X will have 
// been inserted just after A.
expect(list.get(1)==m); 
<!-- END NON-TRANSLATABLE -->
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
    But such a test is more work to create and is likely to be significantly harder to maintain. (Unless you write good
    comments, it will not be at all clear why the test is doing what it's doing.) There are two solutions:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Add the "elementBefore" and "elementAfter" methods to the public interface. But that effectively exposes the
        implementation to everyone and makes future change more difficult.
    </li>
    <li>
        Let the tests "look under the hood" and check pointers directly.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    The latter is usually the best solution, even for a simple class like "DoublyLinkedList" and especially for the more
    complex classes that occur in your products.
</p>
<p>
    Typically, tests are put in the same package as the class they test. They are given protected or friend access.
</p>
<h4>
    Approaches for Test Setup
</h4>
<p>
    To successfully run a test, the system must be in a known state. To do this you will need objects or components in
    memory, rows in the database, etc. that you will test against. The easiest approach is to hardcode the required data
    and the setup code within the test itself. The primary advantage is that all the information that you need about the
    test is in one place and that the test is potentially self-sufficient.
</p>
<p>
    Another approach is to define an external data set which is loaded into memory or into the database at the beginning of
    the test run. There are several advantages to this approach:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        It decouples the test data from the test.
    </li>
    <li>
        More than one test can use the same data set.
    </li>
    <li>
        It is easy to modify and/or multiply the test data.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    There are some disadvantages to this approach:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Increased complexity for maintaining the external data
    </li>
    <li>
        Potential coupling between test cases. When they share a common test data bed it becomes very easy to write tests
        that depend on other tests running first, thereby coupling them together.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Coding for Testability
</h4>
<p>
    Add&nbsp;<a class="elementLink"
    href="./../../../core.tech.common.base/guidances/termdefinitions/code_instrumentation_3060875F.html"
    guid="_lzAWkK9eEdyltJ0KgEd9WQ">code instrumentation</a> for testing and debugging. Pay special attention to the
    implementation of the observation/control points, such as critical functions or objects, as these aspects might need
    special support that has to be implemented in the application under test.
</p>
<h4>
    Reviewing Tests
</h4>
<p>
    If a test will be long-lived, ask a person with less inside knowledge of the implementation element to run it and check
    if there is enough support information. Review it with other people within the development team and other interested
    parties as needed.
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="TestDesignMistakes" name="TestDesignMistakes"></a>Characteristic Test Design Mistakes
</h3>
<p>
    Each test exercises an implementation element and checks for correct results. The design of the test-the inputs it uses
    and how it checks for correctness-can be good at revealing defects, or it can inadvertently hide them. Here are some
    characteristic test design mistakes.
</p>
<h4>
    Failure to specify expected results in advance
</h4>
<p>
    Suppose you're testing an implementation element that converts XML into HTML. A temptation is to take some sample XML,
    run it through the conversion, then look at the results in a browser. If the screen looks right, you "bless" the HTML
    by saving it as the official expected results. Thereafter, a test compares the actual output of the conversion to the
    expected results.
</p>
<p>
    This is a dangerous practice. Even sophisticated computer users are used to believing what the computer does. You are
    likely to overlook mistakes in the screen appearance. (Not to mention that browsers are quite tolerant of misformatted
    HTML.) By making that incorrect HTML the official expected results, you make sure that the test can never find the
    problem.
</p>
<p>
    It's less dangerous to doubly-check by looking directly at the HTML, but it's still dangerous. Because the output is
    complicated, it will be easy to overlook errors. You'll find more defects if you write the expected output by hand
    first.
</p>
<h4>
    Failure to check the background
</h4>
<p>
    Tests usually check that what should have been changed has been, but their creators often forget to check that what
    should have been left alone has been left alone. For example, suppose a program is supposed to change the first 100
    records in a file. It's a good idea to check that the 101<sup>st</sup> hasn't been changed.
</p>
<p>
    In theory, you would check that nothing in the "background"-the entire file system, all of memory, everything reachable
    through the network-has been left alone. In practice, you have to choose carefully what you can afford to check. But
    it's important to make that choice.
</p>
<h4>
    Failure to check persistence
</h4>
<p>
    Just because the implementation element tells you a change has been made, that doesn't mean it has actually been
    committed to the database. You need to check the database via another route.
</p>
<h4>
    Failure to add variety
</h4>
<p>
    A test might be designed to check the effect of three fields in a database record, but many other fields need to be
    filled in to execute the test. Testers will often use the same values over and over again for these "irrelevant"
    fields. For example, they'll always use the name of their lover in a text field, or 999 in a numeric field.
</p>
<p>
    The problem is that sometimes what shouldn't matter actually does. Every so often, there's a bug that depends on some
    obscure combination of unlikely inputs. If you always use the same inputs, you stand no chance of finding such bugs. If
    you persistently vary inputs, you might. Quite often, it costs almost nothing to use a number different than 999 or to
    use someone else's name. When varying the values used in tests costs almost nothing and it has some potential benefit,
    then vary. (Note: It's unwise to use names of old lovers instead of your current one if your current lover works with
    you.)
</p>
<p>
    Here's another benefit. One plausible fault is for the program to use field <i>X</i> when it should have used field
    <i>Y</i>. If both fields contain "Dawn", the fault can't be detected.
</p>
<h4>
    Failure to use realistic data
</h4>
<p>
    It's common to use made-up data in tests. That data is often unrealistically simple. For example, customer names might
    be "Mickey", "Snoopy", and "Donald". Because that data is different from what real users enter - for example, it's
    characteristically shorter - it can miss defects real customers will see. For example, these one-word names wouldn't
    detect that the code doesn't handle names with spaces.
</p>
<p>
    It's prudent to make a slight extra effort to use realistic data.
</p>
<h4>
    Failure to notice that the code does nothing at all
</h4>
<p>
    Suppose you initialize a database record to zero, run a calculation that should result in zero being stored in the
    record, then check that the record is zero. What has your test demonstrated? The calculation might not have taken place
    at all. Nothing might have been stored, and the test couldn't tell.
</p>
<p>
    That example sounds unlikely. But this same mistake can crop up in subtler ways. For example, you might write a test
    for a complicated installer program. The test is intended to check that all temporary files are removed after a
    successful installation. But, because of all the installer options, in that test, one particular temporary file wasn't
    created. Sure enough, that's the one the program forgot to remove.
</p>
<h4>
    Failure to notice that the code does the wrong thing
</h4>
<p>
    Sometimes a program does the right thing for the wrong reasons. As a trivial example, consider this code:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
<!-- START NON-TRANSLATABLE -->
if (a &lt; b &amp;&amp; c) 
return 2 * x;
else
return x * x;
<!-- END NON-TRANSLATABLE -->
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
    The logical expression is wrong, and you've written a test that causes it to evaluate incorrectly and take the wrong
    branch. Unfortunately, purely by coincidence, the variable X has the value 2 in that test. So the result of the wrong
    branch is accidentally correct - the same as the result the right branch would have given.
</p>
<p>
    For each expected result, you should ask if there's a plausible way in which that result could be&nbsp;achieved for the
    wrong reason. While it's often impossible to know, sometimes it's not.

            <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h3>
    Design Mechanism Characteristics and Mapping
</h3>
<p>
    Consider the analysis mechanism for <strong>persistence</strong>.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        There might be a need for many (2,000) small objects (200 bytes each) to be stored for a few seconds, with no need
        for them to survive thereafter.
    </li>
    <li>
        There might be a need for several very large objects to be stored permanently on disk for several months, never
        updated, but with sophisticated means of retrieval.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    These objects require different support for persistency. The best option depends on the characteristics of the design
    mechanism:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>In-memory storag</b><strong>e:</strong> For up to 1 Mb total (size x volume); very fast access for read, write,
        update.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Flash card</b><strong>:</strong> For up to 8 Mb; slow update and write access; moderate read access.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Binary file</b><strong>:</strong> For 100 Kb to 200 Mb; slow update; slow read-and-write access.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Database management system (DBMS)</b><strong>:</strong> For 100 Kb and upward (essentially no upper limit); even
        slower update and read-and-write access.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Note that these speeds are rated as slow only as compared to in-memory storage. Obviously, in some environments,
    caching can improve apparent access times. (See Figure 1.)

        Refining the mapping between design and implementation mechanisms
    </h4>
</div>
<p>
    Initially, the mapping between design mechanisms and implementation mechanisms is likely to be less than optimal, but
    it will get the project running, identify unforeseen risks, and trigger further investigations and evaluations. As the
    project continues and you gain more knowledge, you will need to refine the mapping.
</p>
<p>
    Proceed iteratively to refine the mapping between design and implementation mechanisms. Eliminate redundant paths,
    working both top-down and bottom-up.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Working top-down:</b> When working top-down (from top to bottom), new and refined use-case realizations will put new
    requirements on the necessary design mechanisms through the analysis mechanisms that you need. These new requirements
    might uncover additional characteristics of a design mechanism, forcing a split between mechanisms. A compromise
    between the system's complexity and its performance is also necessary:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Too many different design mechanisms make the system too complex.
    </li>
    <li>
        Too few design mechanisms can create performance problems for implementation mechanisms that stretch the limits of
        the reasonable ranges of the values of their characteristics.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <b>Working bottom-up:</b> When working bottom-up (from bottom to top) and investigating the available implementation
    mechanisms, you might find products that satisfy several design mechanisms at once, but force some adaptation or
    repartitioning of your design mechanisms. You want to minimize the number of implementation mechanisms you use, but too
    few of them can also lead to performance problems.
</p>
<p>
    After you decide to use a DBMS to store class A objects, you might be tempted to use it to store all objects in the
    system. This could be very inefficient or very cumbersome. Not all objects that require persistency need to be stored
    in the DBMS. Some objects may be persistent, but one application may access them frequently, while other applications
    access them only infrequently. A hybrid strategy, in which the object is read from the DBMS into memory and
    periodically synchronized, may be the best approach.
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p class="example">
        <b>Example</b>
    </p>
    <p class="example">
        A flight can be stored both in memory for fast access and in a DBMS for long-term persistency. However, this
        triggers a need for a mechanism to synchronize both.
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    It is not uncommon to have more than one design mechanism associated with a client class as a compromise between
    different characteristics.
</p>
<p>
    Because implementation mechanisms often come in bundles in off-the-shelf components (operating systems and middleware
    products), some optimization based on cost, impedance mismatch, or uniformity of style needs to occur. Also, mechanisms
    are often interdependent, which makes clear separation of services into design mechanisms difficult.
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p class="example">
        <b>Examples</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The notification mechanism can be based on the inter-process communication mechanism.
        </li>
        <li>
            The error reporting mechanism can be based on the persistency mechanism.
        </li>
    </ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
    Refinement continues over the whole Elaboration phase, and is always a compromise between:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        An exact fit with the requirements of the clients of the design mechanism, in terms of the expected
        characteristics.
    </li>
    <li>
        The cost and complexity of having too many different implementation mechanisms to acquire and integrate.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The overall goal is always to have a simple, clean set of mechanisms that give conceptual integrity, simplicity, and
    elegance to a large system.

<h3>
    Describing Design Mechanisms
</h3>
<p>
    As with analysis mechanisms, design mechanisms can be modeled using a collaboration, which may instantiate one or more
    architectural or design patterns.
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <strong>Example: A persistence mechanism</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        This example uses an instance of a pattern for RDBMS-based persistency drawn from <a
        href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdbc/index.html" target="_blank"><u>Java&trade; Database Connectivity (JDBC)</u></a>.
        Although we present the design here, JDBC supplies actual code for some of the classes. Therefore, it is a short
        step from what is presented here to an implementation mechanism.

    To update a class, the persistency client asks the <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">DBClass</font> object to

<p>
    <strong>Remember:</strong> It is the job of <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">DBClass</font> object to flatten

    Modeling Components
</h3>
<p align="left">
    The UML component is a modeling construct that provides the following capabilities:
</p>
<div align="left">
    <ul>
        <li>
            Group classes to define a larger granularity part of a system
        </li>
        <li>
            Separate the visible interfaces from internal implementation
        </li>
        <li>
            Execute instances run-time
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
<p align="left">
    A component includes <strong>provided</strong> and <strong>required</strong> interfaces that form the basis for wiring
    components together. A <strong>provided interface</strong> is one that is either implemented directly by the component
    or one of its realizing classes or subcomponents, or it is the type of a provided port of the component. A
    <strong>required interface</strong> is designated by a usage dependency of the component or one of its realizing
    classes or subcomponents, or it is the type of a required port.
</p>
<p align="left">
    A component has an external view (or <em>black box</em> view) through its publicly visible properties and operations
    .Optionally, a behavior such as a protocol state machine may be attached to an interface, a port, and the component
    itself to define the external view more precisely by making dynamic constraints in the sequence of operation calls
    explicit. The wiring between components in a system or other context can be structurally defined by using dependencies
    between component interfaces (typically on component diagrams).
</p>
<p align="left">
    Optionally, you can make a more detailed specification of the structural collaboration by using parts and connectors in
    composite structures to specify the role or instance-level collaboration between components. That is the component's
    internal view (or <em>white-box</em> view) through its private properties and realizing classes or subcomponents. This
    view shows how the external behavior is realized internally. The mapping between external and internal views is by
    dependencies on components diagrams or delegation connectors to internal parts on composite structure diagrams.
</p>
<p align="left">
    A number of UML standard stereotypes exist that apply to components, including &lt;&lt;subsystem&gt;&gt; to model
    large-scale components, and &lt;&lt;specification&gt;&gt; and &lt;&lt;realization&gt;&gt; to model components with
    distinct specification and realization definitions, where one specification may have multiple realizations.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="left">
    The recommendation is to&nbsp;use components as the representation for design subsystems.

    UML Definitions -- A History

<p align="left">
    The definition of <em>component</em> with the UML has changed over time with the release of different versions. The
    version of UML you use may be constrained by the capabilities of the modeling tools you use. That is why the
    definitions from 1.3 to 2.0 are provided here.
</p>
<p align="left">
    UML 2.0 defined <em>component</em> as the following:

        <p align="left">
            A component defines its behavior in terms of provided and required interfaces. As such, a component serves as a
            type whose conformance is defined by these provided and required interfaces (encompassing both their static as
            well as dynamic semantics).
        </p>

    Introduction
</h3>
<p>
    Software architecture is a concept that is easy to understand, and that most engineers intuitively feel, especially
    with a little experience, but it is hard to define precisely. In particular, it is difficult to draw a sharp line
    between design and architecture-architecture is one aspect of design that concentrates on some specific features.
</p>
<p>
    In An Introduction to Software Architecture, David Garlan and Mary Shaw suggest that software architecture is a level
    of design concerned with issues: "Beyond the algorithms and data structures of the computation; designing and
    specifying the overall system structure emerges as a new kind of problem. Structural issues include gross organization
    and global control structure; protocols for communication, synchronization, and data access; assignment of
    functionality to design elements; physical distribution; composition of design elements; scaling and performance; and
    selection among design alternatives." <a class="elementlinkwithusertext"
    href="./../../../core.tech.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.tech_6CCF393.html"
    guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">[GAR93]</a>
</p>
<p>
    But there is more to architecture than just structure; the IEEE Working Group on Architecture defines it as "the
    highest-level concept of a system in its environment" <a class="elementlinkwithusertext"
    href="./../../../core.tech.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.tech_6CCF393.html"
    guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">[IEP1471]</a>. It also encompasses the "fit" with system integrity, with economical
    constraints, with aesthetic concerns, and with style. It is not limited to an inward focus, but takes into
    consideration the system as a whole in its user environment and its development environment - an outward focus.
</p>
<p>
    The architecture focuses on specific aspects of the overall system design, concentrating on structure, essential
    elements, key scenarios and those aspects that have a lasting impact on system qualities such as performance,
    reliability, adaptability and cost. It also defines the set of <a class="elementLink"
    href="./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/arch_mechanism_2932DFB6.html"
    guid="_mzxI0A4LEduibvKwrGxWxA">Architectural Mechanism</a>s, <a class="elementLink"
    href="./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/pattern_10BE6D96.html"
    guid="_0YJvUMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Pattern</a>s and styles that will guide the rest of the design, assuring its integrity.
</p>
<h3>
    Purpose of Architecture
</h3>
<p>
    The architecture can be used for many things:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>To describe the essential structure of the system and the decisions guiding the structure of the
        system</strong> so the integrity and understandability of the system is assured.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a id="Comment71_" name="Comment71_"><strong>To identify and attack risks to the system</strong> (using the
        architecture as an artifact of governance)</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>To provide context and guidance for developers</strong> to construct the system by describing the
        motivations behind the architectural decisions so those decisions can be robustly implemented. The architecture
        services as the blueprint for development.&nbsp;For example, the architect may place constraints on how data is
        packaged and communicated between different parts of the system. This may appear to be a burden, but the
        justification in the Architecture Notebook can explain that there is a significant performance bottleneck when
        communicating with a legacy system. The rest of the system must adapt to this bottleneck by following a specific
        data packaging scheme.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>To provide an overview of the system to whoever must maintain the architecture</strong>, as well as an
        understanding of the motivation behind the important technical decisions.&nbsp; Team members who were not involved
        in those architectural decisions need to understand the reasoning behind the&nbsp;context of the architecture so
        they can best address the needs of the system.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>To define the project structure and team organization.</strong> Architectural elements make excellent units
        of implementation, unit testing, integration, configuration management and&nbsp;documentation.&nbsp;&nbsp; They can
        also be used to define&nbsp; so that managers can plan the project.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Architecture Description
</h3>
<p>
    To speak and reason about software architecture, you must first define an architectural representation, a way of
    describing important aspects of an architecture.
</p>
<p>

    The architecture can contain any information and references that are appropriate in communicating how developers should
    build the system.
</p>
<h4>
    Architectural Representation
</h4>
<p>
    The architecture can be represented in many forms and from many viewpoints, depending on the needs of the project and
    the preferences of the project team. It need not be a formal document. The essence of the architecture can often be
    communicated through a series of simple diagrams on a whiteboard; or as a list of decisions. The illustration just
    needs to show the nature of the proposed solution, convey the governing ideas, and represent the major building blocks
    to make it easier to communicate the architecture to the project team and stakeholders.
</p>
<p>
    If a more complex system is required, then the architecture can be represented as a more comprehensive set
    of&nbsp;views that describe the architecture from a number of viewpoints. For more information, see <a
    class="elementLinkWithType"
    href="./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/arch_views_viewpoints_7A6CD31.html"
    guid="_kgtcoNc8Edyd7OybSySFxg">Concept: Architectural Views and Viewpoints</a>.
</p>
<p>
    The architecture can be expressed as a simple metaphor or as a comparison to a predefined architectural style or set of
    styles. It may be a precise set of models or documents that describe the various aspects of the system's key elements.
    Expressing it as skeletal implementation is another option - although this may need to be baselined and preserved to
    ensure that the essence of the system can be understood as the system grows. Choose the medium that best meets the
    needs of the project.

<h3>
    Architectural Patterns

    href="./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/pattern_10BE6D96.html"
    guid="_0YJvUMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Pattern</a>s are ready-made forms that solve recurring architectural problems. An
    architectural framework or an architectural infrastructure (middleware) is a set of components on which you can build a
    certain kind of architecture. Many of the major architectural difficulties should be resolved in the framework or in
    the infrastructure, usually targeted to a specific domain: command and control, MIS, control system, and so on.

<h3>
    <a id="Architectural Style" name="Architectural Style">Architectural Style</a>
</h3>
<p>
    A software architecture (or an architectural view) may have an attribute called <b>architectural style</b>, which
    reduces the set of possible forms to choose from, and imposes a certain degree of uniformity to the architecture. The
    style may be defined by a set of patterns, or by the choice of specific components or connectors as the basic building
    blocks.
</p>
<h3>
    Architectural Timing
</h3>
<p>
    Teams should expect to spend more time on architectural issues early in the project.&nbsp; This allows the team to
    reduce risk associated to technology early in the project, hence allowing the team to more rapidly reduce the variance
    in their estimate on what they can deliver at what time. Examples of architectural issues that needs to be resolved
    early on include the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Component and their major interfaces.
    </li>
    <li>
        Major technology choices (platform, languages, architecture frameworks / reference architectures, etc.).
    </li>
    <li>
        Interfaces to external systems.
    </li>
    <li>
        Common services (persistence mechanisms, logging mechanisms, garbage collection, etc.).
    </li>
    <li>
        Key patterns.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Validating the Architecture
</h3>
<p>
    The best way to validate the architecture is to actually implement it.&nbsp; For more information, see <a

    The software industry and literature use the term <strong>componen</strong>t to refer to many different things. It is
    often used in the broad sense to mean a constituent part. It is also frequently used in a narrow sense to denote
    specific characteristics that enable replacement and assembly in larger systems.
</p>
<p align="left">
    The Unified Modeling Language [<a class="elementLinkWithUserText"
    href="./../../../core.tech.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.tech_6CCF393.html"
    guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">UML05</a>] defines <em>component</em> as follows:
</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            A modular part of a system that encapsulates its contents and whose manifestation is replaceable within its
            environment. A component defines its behavior in terms of provided and required interfaces. As such, a
            component serves as a type, whose conformance is defined by these provided and required interfaces
            (encompassing both their static as well as dynamic semantics).
        </p>
        <p>
            A <em>component</em> is defined as a subtype of structured class. Therefore, a component has attributes and
            operations, is able to participate in associations and generalizations, and has internal structure and ports.
        </p>
    </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">
    Here, we use&nbsp;the term <em>component&nbsp;</em>in a&nbsp;broader way than the UML definition. Rather than defining
    components as having characteristics, such as modularity, deployability, and replaceability, we instead recommend these
    as desirable characteristics of components. We use <em>component</em> to mean <strong>an encapsulated part of a
    system</strong> that is nontrivial, nearly independent, and replaceable part of a system that fulfills a clear function
    in the context of well-defined architecture. This includes two types of components:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div align="left">
            <p>
                <strong>Design component.</strong> A significant encapsulated part of the design that includes design
                subsystems and, sometimes, significant design classes and design packages.
            </p>
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div align="left">
            <p>
                <strong>Implementation component.</strong> A significant encapsulated part of the implementation, generally
                code that implements a design component.
            </p>
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<p align="left">
    Ideally, the design reflects the implementation; therefore, you can simply refer to <em>components</em>, with each
    component having a design and an implementation.
</p>
<p align="left">
    Components interact through interfaces&nbsp;and&nbsp;may be composed of successively smaller components and interfaces.
</p>
<h3 align="left">
    Component replaceability
</h3>
<p align="left">
    In UML terminology, components should be replaceable. However, this may mean only that the component exposes a set of
    interfaces that hide an underlying implementation.
</p>
<p align="left">
    There are other, stronger, kinds of replaceability: .
</p>
<div align="left">
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                <strong>Source file replaceability:</strong> If two classes are implemented in a single source code file,
                then those classes cannot usually be separately versioned and controlled. However, if a set of files fully
                implements a single component (and no other component), then the component source files are replaceable.
                This characteristic makes it easier to use version control, to use the file as a baseline, and to reuse the
                source file.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <strong>Deployment replaceability:</strong> If two classes are deployed in a single executable file, then
                each class is not independently replaceable in a deployed system. It is desirable for larger-granularity
                components to be replaceable during deployment, which allows new versions of the component to be deployed
                without having to rebuild the other components. This usually means that there is one file or one set of
                files that deploy the component, and no other component.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <strong>Run-time replaceability:</strong> If a component can be redeployed into a running system, then it
                is referred to as <em>run-time replaceable</em>. This enables you to upgrade software without loss of
                availability.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <strong>Location transparency:</strong> Components with network-addressable interfaces are referred to as
                having <em>location transparency</em>. This allows components to be relocated to other servers or to be
                replicated on multiple servers to support fault tolerance, load balancing, and so on. These kinds of
                components are often referred to as <em>distributed</em> or <em>distributable</em> components.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
<h3 align="left">
    Component instantiation
</h3>
<p align="left">
    A component may or may not be directly instantiated at run time.
</p>
<p align="left">
    An indirectly instantiated component is implemented, or realized, by a set of classes, subcomponents, or parts. The
    component itself does not appear in the implementation; it merely serves as a design that an implementation must
    follow. The set of realizing classes, subcomponents, or parts must cover the entire set of operations specified in the
    provided interface of the component. The manner of implementing the component is the responsibility of the implementer.
</p>
<p align="left">
    A directly instantiated component specifies its own encapsulated implementation. It is instantiated as an addressable
    object, which means that a design component has a corresponding construct in the implementation language; therefore, it
    can be referenced explicitly.

    What are Architectural Mechanisms?
</h3>
<p>
    Architectural Mechanisms are common solutions to common problems that can be used during development to minimize
    complexity.&nbsp; They represent key technical concepts that&nbsp;will be standardized across the solution.&nbsp;
    Architecture mechanisms facilitate the evolution of architecturally significant aspects of the system. They allow the
    team to maintain a cohesive architecture while enabling implementation details to be deferred until they really need to
    be made.
</p>
<p>
    Architectural Mechanisms are&nbsp;used to satisfy architecturally significant requirements. Usually those are
    non-functional requirements such as performance and security issues.&nbsp;When fully described, Architectural
    Mechanisms show patterns of structure and behavior in the software. They&nbsp;form the basis of&nbsp;common
    software&nbsp;that will be&nbsp;consistently applied&nbsp;across the product being developed. They also form the basis
    for standardizing the way that the software works; therefore, they are an important element of the overall software
    architecture. The definition of architecture mechanisms also enable decisions on whether existing software components
    can be leveraged to provide the required behavior; or whether new software should be bought or built.
</p>
<p>
    The value in defining architecture mechanisms is that they:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Explicitly call out&nbsp;aspects of the solution mechanics that are common across the system. This helps you plan.
    </li>
    <li>
        Put down markers for the developers to build those aspects of the system once and then re-use them. This reduces
        the workload.
    </li>
    <li>
        Promote the development of a consistent set of services. This makes the system easier to maintain.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    An&nbsp;Architectural Mechanism can have three states: Analysis, Design and Implementation.&nbsp;These
    categories&nbsp;reflect the maturity of the mechanism's description. The state changes as successive levels of detail
    are uncovered during when you refine <a class="elementLink"

    Be aware that these states are frequently referred to themselves as Analysis, Design and Implementation
    mechanisms.&nbsp;These are synonyms and merely represent the architecture mechanisms in different states of
    development. The transition from one state to another&nbsp;can often be obvious or intuitive. Therefore, it can be
    achieved in a matter of seconds. It can also require more considered analysis and design, thus take longer.&nbsp;The
    important point here is that these categories of mechanisms apply to the same concept in different states. The only
    difference between them is one of refinement or detail.
</p>
<p>
    The following diagram illustrates the transition of Architectural Mechanisms from one state to another.

<h3>
    What Information Should be Captured for Architectural Mechanisms?
</h3>
<p>
    The information captured for each architectural mechanism category/state is different (though the information can be
    seen as refinements of each other):
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Analysis Mechanisms</strong>, which give the mechanism a name, brief description and some basic
        attributes&nbsp;derived from&nbsp;the project requirements
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Design Mechanisms</strong>, which are more concrete and assume some details of the implementation
        environment
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Implementation Mechanisms</strong>, which specify the&nbsp;exact implementation of&nbsp;each mechanism
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    When&nbsp;a mechanism is&nbsp;initially identified, it can be considered a marker that says to the team, "We are going
    to handle this aspect of the system in a standard way. We'll figure out the details later." As the project proceeds,
    the architectural mechanisms are gradually refined until they become part of the software.
</p>
<h4>
    Analysis Mechanisms
</h4>
<p>
    Analysis mechanisms&nbsp;are the initial state for an architectural mechanism. They are identified early in the project
    and represent&nbsp;bookmarks for future software development. They allow the&nbsp;team to focus on understanding the
    requirements without getting distracted by the specifics of a complex implementation. Analysis mechanisms are
    discovered by surveying the requirements and looking for recurrent technical concepts.&nbsp;Security, persistence and
    legacy interface are some examples of these. In effect, the analysis mechanism is where the requirements that
    describe&nbsp;architecturally significant topics&nbsp;are collated and brought&nbsp;together in a single list. This
    makes them easier to manage.
</p>
<p>
    Analysis mechanisms are described in simple terms:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Name:</strong> Identifies the mechanism.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Basic attributes:</strong> Define the requirements of the mechanism. These attributes can vary depending
        upon the mechanism being analyzed. Refer to <a class="elementLinkWithType"
        href="./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/examples/architectural_mechanism_attributes_B0ECA2F7.html"
        guid="_eQ_s8Om5Edupia_tZIXEqg">Example: Architectural Mechanism Attributes</a>&nbsp;for more guidance.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Once the list of analysis mechanisms has been defined it can be prioritized and the mechanisms refined in line
    with&nbsp;iteration&nbsp;objectives. It is not necessary to develop the entire set of architecture mechanisms into
    working software in a single pass. It is often more sensible to develop only those mechanisms required to support the
    functionality to be delivered in the current iteration.
</p>
<h4>
    Design Mechanisms
</h4>
<p>
    Design mechanisms&nbsp;represent decisions about the concrete technologies that are going to be used to&nbsp;develop
    architectural mechanisms. For example, the decision to use an RDBMS for persistence. It's often no more complicated
    than that (though of course, the effort involved in making the decision can sometimes be quite complex).
</p>
<p>
    The decision on when to refine an architectural mechanism from an analysis state to a design state is largely
    arbitrary. Often there will be constraints on the project that&nbsp;force the decision on some of these issues. For
    example, there may be a corporate standard for databases which mean that the decision&nbsp;for the&nbsp;persistence
    mechanism can be made on day 1 of the project.
</p>
<p>
    On other occasions the decision may point to products that the project team has not yet acquired.&nbsp;If so,&nbsp;the
    decision needs to be made in time to enable the required products to be made available to the team.
</p>
<p>
    It can often be useful to develop some prototype code to prove that these decisions are sound. The architect should be
    confident that the technologies being selected are able to fulfill the requirements. The attributes captured against
    the corresponding analysis mechanisms should be used as criteria to prove the validity of the decisions.
</p>
<h4>
    Implementation Mechanism
</h4>
<p>
    An implementation mechanism&nbsp;specifies the actual implementation for the architectural mechanism (hence the
    name).&nbsp;It can be modeled as a design pattern or presented as&nbsp;example code.
</p>
<p>
    The best time to&nbsp;produce the&nbsp;implementation mechanism is usually when the first piece of functionality that
    needs it is scheduled for development. Architects and developers work together to develop this.
</p>

</p>
<p>
    Analysis Mechanisms&nbsp;allow the developer to focus on understanding the requirements without getting distracted by
    the specifics of a complex implementation. They are a way of abstracting away the complexity of the solution, so people
    can better comprehend the problem.
</p>
<p>
    Analysis Mechanisms are described in simple terms:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Name:</strong> Identifies the mechanism.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Basic attributes:</strong> Define the requirements of the mechanism.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    You can identify Analysis Mechanisms top-down, from previous knowledge, or bottom-up, meaning that you discover them as
    you proceed.
</p>
<p>
    In the top-down mode, you are guided by experience -- you know that certain problems are present in the domain and will
    require certain kinds of solutions. Examples of common architectural problems that might be expressed as mechanisms
    during analysis are: persistence, transaction management, fault management, messaging, and inference engines. The
    common aspect of all of these is that each is a general capability of a broad class of systems, and each provides
    functionality that interacts with or supports the basic application functionality. The Analysis Mechanisms support
    capabilities required in the basic functional requirements of the system, regardless of the platform that it is
    deployed upon or the implementation language. Analysis Mechanisms also can be designed and implemented in different
    ways. Generally, there will be more than one design mechanism that corresponds with each Analysis Mechanism. There may
    also be more than one way of implementing each design mechanism.
</p>
<p>
    The bottom-up approach is where Analysis Mechanisms ultimately originate. They are created as the you see, perhaps
    faintly at first, a common theme emerging from a set of solutions to various problems. For example: There is a need to
    provide a way for elements in different threads to synchronize their clocks, and there is a need for a common way of
    allocating resources. <a class="elementLink"
    href="./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/analysis_mechanism_8369C159.html"
    guid="_0gvqoMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Analysis Mechanism</a>s, which simplify the language of analysis, emerge from these
    patterns.
</p>
<p>
    Identifying an Analysis Mechanism means that you identify a common, perhaps implicit&nbsp;subproblem, and you give it a
    name. Initially, the name might be all that exists. For example, the system will require a persistence
    mechanism.&nbsp;Ultimately, this mechanism will be implemented through the collaboration of various classes, some of
    which do not deliver application functionality directly, but exist only to support it. Very often these support classes
    are located in the middle or lower layers of a layered architecture, thereby providing a common support service to all
    application-level classes.
</p>
<p>
    If the subproblem that you identify is common enough, perhaps a pattern exists from which the mechanism can be
    instantiated, probably by binding existing classes and implementing new ones, as required by the pattern. An Analysis
    Mechanism produced this way will be abstract, and it will require further refinement throughout design and
    implementation work.

    An executable architecture is an implementation that realizes the <a class="elementLink"

    guid="__O7tAMVvEduLYZUGfgZrkQ">Software Architecture</a>. It is used to validate that the <a class="elementLink"

    guid="_HrZGIA4MEduibvKwrGxWxA">Architecturally Significant Requirements</a>&nbsp;are correctly implemented. It
    validates the architecture as an integrated whole through integration tests. The team gains feedback about the
    architecture from the customer or stakeholder by providing the executable architecture for verification. This way the
    executable architecture helps to assure that the core functionality is stable enough to build the remainder of the
    system.
</p>
<p>
    An executable architecture is not a work product. It's an identification or attribute of the implementation,
    indicating&nbsp;that the implementation&nbsp;contains stable architecturally significant functionality.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Each version of an executable architecture should be more complete and robust than previous versions. The final
    executable architecture contains all the elements that make up the architecture and should validate all architecturally
    significant requirements. There may be rare exceptions where a portion of the architecture can't practically be
    implemented until later due to uncontrollable circumstances such as constraints with third part software or unique
    resources that are unavailable.&nbsp;Delaying any part of the architecture should be avoided as it raises significant
    technical risk later in the project. But if circumstances dictate that some architectural risk can't be mitigated
    until&nbsp;later in development, a&nbsp;conscious decision can be made to carry this risk forward until the
    architecture can be fully implemented.
</p>
<p>
    It's also possible to include non-architectural elements into an executable architecture. This will most likely happen
    when addressing high risk issues early in the development cycle, which is an excellent practice. Two examples of
    non-technical risks are resource risks and competitive risks. It may be desirable to obtain a difficult-to-get resource
    early so they can work on a unique piece of the software now, rather than hoping the resource will be available later.
    Or it may be useful to implement and deploy some early features to maintain market share against a competitor. Think of
    the executable architecture as a way to mitigate architectural risk, which is the most significant technical risk in a
    project. From this perspective, it's appropriate to mitigate other risks in the executable architecture.
</p>
<p>
    The difference between the executable architecture and the implementation later in the development cycle is that the
    executable architecture is the result of a period of development (for example&nbsp;an iteration) that's dedicated to
    elaborating the architecture. Later iterations build onto the executable architecture but are not flagged as an
    executable architecture because they extend the system's functionality beyond the architectural framework.

    Architecture can be represented from a variety of viewpoints, all of which can be combined to create a holistic view of
    the system. Each architectural view addresses some specific set of concerns, specific to stakeholders in the
    development process: users, designers, managers, system engineers, maintainers, and so on.
</p>
<p>
    The views capture the major structural design decisions by showing how the software architecture is decomposed into
    components, and how components are connected by connectors to produce useful forms <a class="elementlinkwithusertext"
    href="./../../../core.tech.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.tech_6CCF393.html#PW92"
    guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">[PW92]</a>. These design choices must be tied to the requirements -- functional and
    supplementary -- and other constraints. But these choices in turn put further constraints on the requirements, and on
    future design decisions at a lower level.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    In essence, architectural views are abstractions, or simplifications, of the entire design, in which important
    characteristics are made more visible by leaving details aside. These characteristics are important when reasoning
    about:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        System evolution-going to the next development cycle.
    </li>
    <li>
        Reuse of the architecture, or parts of it, in the context of a product line.
    </li>
    <li>
        Assessment of supplementary qualities, such as performance, availability, portability, and safety.
    </li>
    <li>
        Assignment of development work to teams or subcontractors.
    </li>
    <li>
        Decisions about including off-the-shelf components.
    </li>
    <li>
        Insertion in a wider system.&nbsp;
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    To choose the appropriate set of views,&nbsp;identify the stakeholders who depend on software architecture
    documentation and the information that they need. For an example of a set of views that have been used to represent

<h3>
    Communication
</h3>
<p>
    For all model elements that need to communicate with components or services that are running in other processes or
    threads, you need to identify:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            <b>Latency</b><b>:</b> How fast must processes communicate with another?
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <b>Synchronicity</b><b>:</b> Asynchronous communication
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <b>Size of message</b><b>:</b> A spectrum might be more appropriate than a single number
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <b>Protocol:</b> Flow control, buffering, and so on
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Notice that there is no design-level information or specification here. Instead, this is more about collating and
    refining architecturally significant requirements.

            <MainDescription><![CDATA[<p>
    Architecturally significant requirements are those requirements that play an important role in determining the
    architecture of the system.&nbsp; Such requirements require special attention. Not all requirements have equal
    significance with regards to the architecture.
</p>
<p>
    Architecturally significant requirements&nbsp;are a subset of the requirements that need to be satisfied before the
    architecture can be considered "stable". Typically, these are requirements that are technically challenging,
    technically constraining, or central to the system's purpose. Furthermore, the system will generally be more sensitive
    to changes&nbsp;against architecturally significant requirements, so identifying and communicating this subset will
    help others understand the potential implications of change.
</p>
<p>
    Requirements can be explicitly or implicitly architecturally significant. Explicitly significant requirements are often
    overtly technical in nature, such as performance targets; the need to interface to other systems; the number of users
    that must be supported; or security requirements. Implicitly significant requirements may define the essence of the
    functional behaviour of the system (for example, making a purchase from an on-line store).
</p>
<p>
    Deciding whether a specific requirement is architecturally significant is often a matter of judgment. The selection of
    requirements that are considered "architecturally significant" is driven by several key driving factors:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The benefit of the requirement to stakeholders: critical, <b>important</b>, or <b>useful</b>.
    </li>
    <li>
        The architectural impact of the requirement: <b>none</b>, <b>extends</b>, or <b>modifies</b>. There may be critical
        requirements that have little or no impact on the architecture and low-benefit requirements that have a big impact.
        Low-benefit requirements with big architectural impacts should be reviewed by the project manager for possible
        removal from the scope of the project.
    </li>
    <li>
        The risks to be mitigated: performance, availability of a product, and suitability of a component.
    </li>
    <li>
        The completion of the coverage of the architecture.
    </li>
    <li>
        Other tactical objectives or constraints, such as demonstration to the user, and so on.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    There may be two requirements that hit the same components and address similar risks. If you implement A first, then B
    is not architecturally significant. If you implement B first, then A is not architecturally significant. Thus these
    attributes can depend on the order the requirements are realized, and should be re-evaluated when the order changes, as
    well as when the requirements themselves change.
</p>
<p>
    The following are good examples of Architecturally Significant Requirements:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The system must record every modification to customer records for audit purposes.
    </li>
    <li>
        The system must respond within 5 seconds.
    </li>
    <li>
        The system must&nbsp;deploy on Microsoft Windows XP and Linux.
    </li>
    <li>
        The system must encrypt all network traffic.
    </li>
    <li>
        The ATM system must dispense cash on&nbsp;demand&nbsp;to validated account holders with sufficient cleared funds.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Architecturally significant requirements also describe key behaviors that the system needs to perform.&nbsp; Such
    scenarios represent the important interactions between key abstractions.and should be identified as architecturally
    significant requirements. For example, for an on-line book store describing the way the software handles the scenarios
    for ordering a book and checking out the shopping cart are often enough to communicate the essence of the architecture.

    Architectural goals provide the motivation and rationale&nbsp;for decisions. These goals are&nbsp;often driven
    by&nbsp;the software requirements, particularly system-wide requirements [<a class="elementLinkWithUserText"

    guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">ALL02</a>].
</p>
<p>
    Architectural goals define how the system needs to respond to change over time. Architectural goals tend to address the
    following questions:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        What is the expected lifespan of the system?
    </li>
    <li>
        Will the system need to respond to technological changes over that time, such as new versions of middleware or
        other products?
    </li>
    <li>
        How&nbsp;frequently is&nbsp;the system&nbsp;expected to adapt to change?
    </li>
    <li>
        What changes can we anticipate in the future, and how can we make them easier to accommodate?
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    These considerations will have a significant effect on the structure of the system.

    A variety of factors may place constraints on the architecture being developed:
</p>
<div style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2em">
    <ul>
        <li>
            Network topology
        </li>
        <li>
            Use of a given database vendor or an existing database
        </li>
        <li>
            Web environment (server configurations, firewall, DMZs, and so forth)
        </li>
        <li>
            Servers (hardware model, operating system)
        </li>
        <li>
            Use of third-party software or a particular technology
        </li>
        <li>
            Compliance with existing standards
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
<p>
    For example, if the company uses only one type of database, you will probably try to use it as much as possible to
    leverage&nbsp;the existing database administration skills, rather than introducing a new one.
</p>
<p>
    These architectural constraints, combined with the requirements, help you define&nbsp;an appropriate&nbsp;candidate for
    the system architecture. Capturing these constraints will ease integration with the environment; and may reduce risk,
    cost and duplication of solution elements.

    Key abstractions are the key concepts and abstractions that the system needs to handle. They are those things that,
    without which, you could not describe the system.
</p>
<p>
    The requirements are good sources for key abstractions. These abstractions are often easily identified because they
    represent things that are significant to the business. For example, Customer and Account are typical key abstractions
    in the banking business.
</p>
<p>
    Each key abstraction should have a short description.&nbsp; The are usually not described in detail as they will change
    and evolve&nbsp;during the course of the project (as they are refined into actual design elements).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    The value of defining the key abstractions (and any obvious relationships between them) is that they establish a common
    understanding of the key concepts amongst the team, thereby enabling them to develop a&nbsp;coherent solution that
    handles them consistently.&nbsp;

    You may want to consider the following views (not all views are relevant to all systems or all the stakeholders). This
    set of views is known as the 4+1 Views of Software Architecture [<a class="elementLinkWithUserText"
    href="./../../../core.tech.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.tech_6CCF393.html"

</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Use-case view</strong>: Describes functionality of the system, its external interfaces, and its
            principal users. This view is mandatory when using the 4+1 Views, because all elements of the architecture
            should be derived from requirements.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Logical view</strong>: Describes how the system is structured in terms of units of implementation. The
            elements are packages, classes, and interfaces. The relationship between elements shows dependencies, interface
            realizations, part-whole relationships, and so forth. Note: This view is mandatory when using the 4+1 Views of
            Software Architecture.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Implementation view</strong>: Describes how development artifacts are organized in the file system. The
            elements are files and directories (any configuration items). This includes development artifacts and
            deployment artifacts. This view is optional when using the 4+1 Views.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Process view</strong>: Describes how the run-time system is structured as a set of elements that have
            run-time behavior and interactions. Run-time structure often bears little resemblance to the code structure. It
            consists of rapidly changing networks of communication objects. The elements are components that have run-time
            presence (processes, threads, Enterprise JavaBeans&trade; (EJB&trade;), servlets, DLLs, and so on), data stores, and
            complex connectors, such as queues. Interaction between elements varies, based on technology. This view is
            useful for thinking about run-time system quality attributes, such as performance and reliability. This view is
            optional when using the 4+1 Views.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Deployment view</strong>: Describe how the system is mapped to the hardware. This view is optional when
            using the 4+1 Views.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    In addition, you may wish to represent the following,
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Data view</strong>: A specialization of the logical view. Use this view if persistence is a significant
            aspect of the system, and the translation from the design model to the data model is not done automatically by
            the persistence mechanism.

<p align="center">
    Visual modeling raises the level of abstraction
</p>
<p>
    Visual modeling is the use of semantically rich, graphical and textual design notations to capture software designs. A
    notation, such as UML, allows the level of abstraction to be raised, while maintaining rigorous syntax and semantics.
    In this way, it improves communication in the design team, as the design is formed and reviewed, allowing the reader to
    reason about the design, and it provides an unambiguous basis for implementation.
</p>
<h3>
    How visual models help
</h3>
<p>
    A model is a simplified view of a system. It shows the essentials of the system from a particular perspective and hides
    the nonessential details. Visual models help you:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Increase understanding of complex systems
    </li>
    <li>
        Explore and compare design alternatives at a low cost
    </li>
    <li>
        Form a foundation for implementation
    </li>
    <li>
        Capture requirements precisely
    </li>
    <li>
        Communicate decisions unambiguously
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Increase understanding of complex systems
</h4>
<p>
    The importance of models increases as systems become more complex. For example, you can build a doghouse without
    blueprints. However, as you progress to building houses and then to skyscrapers, your need for blueprints becomes
    pronounced.
</p>
<p>
    Similarly, a small application built by one person in a few days may be easily understood in its entirety. However, an
    e&nbsp;-&nbsp;commerce system with tens of thousands of source lines of code (SLOCs) or an air traffic control system
    with hundreds of thousands of SLOCs can no longer be easily understood by one person. Constructing models allows a
    developer to focus on the big picture, understand how components interact, and identify fatal flaws.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Among the various types of models are these examples:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Use cases to specify behavior unambiguously
    </li>
    <li>
        Class diagrams and data model diagrams to capture design
    </li>
    <li>
        State transition diagrams to model dynamic behavior
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Modeling is important because it helps the team visualize, construct, and document the structure and behavior of the
    system without getting lost in complexity.
</p>
<h4>
    Explore and compare design alternatives at a low cost
</h4>
<p>
    You can create and modify simple models inexpensively to explore design alternatives. Innovative ideas can be captured
    and reviewed by other developers before investing in costly code development. When coupled with iterative development,
    visual modeling helps developers assess design changes and communicate these changes to the entire development team.
</p>
<h4>
    Form a foundation for implementation
</h4>
<p>
    Today, many projects employ object-oriented programming languages to build reusable, change-tolerant, and stable
    systems. To get these benefits, it is even more important to use object technology in design.
</p>
<p>
    The creation of visual models, whether&nbsp;on paper; around a whiteboard; or in a modeling tool,&nbsp;can help a team
    to gain agreement on key aspects of the system before investing time&nbsp;in proving&nbsp;their ideas&nbsp;with code.
    Having a shared model of the system promotes collaboration within the team, encouraging everyone to work towards the
    same goal.
</p>
<p>
    With the support of appropriate tools, you can use a design model to generate an initial code for implementation. This
    is referred to as <strong>forward engineering</strong> or <strong>code generation</strong>. You can also enhance design
    models to include enough information to build the system.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Reverse engineering</strong> may also be applied to generate design models from existing implementations. You
    can use this method to evaluate existing implementations.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Round-trip engineering</strong> combines both forward and reverse engineering techniques to ensure consistent
    design and code. Combined with an iterative process and the right tools, round-trip engineering allows you to
    synchronize the design and code during each iteration.
</p>
<h4>
    Capture requirements precisely
</h4>
<p>
    Before building a system, it's critical to capture the requirements. Specifying the requirements using a precise and
    unambiguous model helps to ensure that all stakeholders can understand and agree on the requirements.
</p>
<p>
    A model that separates the external behavior of the system from the implementation of it helps you focus on the
    intended use of the system, without getting bogged down in implementation details.
</p>
<h4>
    Communicate decisions unambiguously
</h4>
<p>
    The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is&nbsp;a consistent notation that can be applied for system engineering, as well
    as for business engineering. According to these excerpts from the UML specification, a standard notation::
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            Serves as a language for communicating decisions that are not obvious or cannot be inferred from the code
            itself.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Provides semantics that are rich enough to capture all important strategic and tactical decisions.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Offers a form concrete enough for humans to reason [about] and for tools to manipulate.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    UML represents the convergence of the best practice in software modeling throughout the object-technology industry. For

    Model key perspectives

    Modeling helps raise the level of abstraction because you simplify complex ideas and represent them visually, as

            <MainDescription><![CDATA[<p>
    When applying visual modeling, you can use various techniques:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Identify the key perspectives:</strong> Focus on modeling the things that count. Few (if any) projects
        benefit from modeling the entire design to a great level of detail. Make sure that you understand why you are
        modeling something and who will benefit.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Communicate key architectural perspectives:</strong> Even if you choose to model very little&nbsp;of your
        design, it is often advantageous to produce diagrams that communicate the key architectural aspects of the system.
        Conveying the "big picture" to the rest of the team helps them understand the overall approach and develop cohesive
        software.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Sketch the design:</strong> Not all models need to be detailed completely and presented in a software
        modeling tool. It is often perfectly acceptable (if not desirable) to produce hand-drawn sketches on paper or on a
        whiteboard when you are exploring and communicating the architecture and design with your team. You can use a
        digital camera or an electronic whiteboard to capture these diagrams and share them. For many small projects, this
        is often all you need. See <a href="http://www.agilemodeling.com/">http://www.agilemodeling.com/</a> for more
        information.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Use a modeling tool as needed</strong>:&nbsp;If the team members are changing models throughout the
        project, sharing patterns/structure, debugging design, describing behavior, etc., then static photos or paper will
        become difficult to work with. The team may want to capture design in a software modeling tool. Other than
        communicating the design to the team, another benefit of a such a tool is the&nbsp;generation of structural code
        from the models. Many software development tools allow you to view the code as models, making it easier to
        comprehend static and dynamic aspects of a complex code base.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Agree on a standard notation:</strong> In a team environment, it is important that others can understand
        your diagrams without much explanation. Choosing a standard notation enables others to quickly comprehend your
        diagrams without ambiguity. The Unified Modeling Language (UML) provides an industry-standard approach to software
        modeling and is an example of a widely understood notation.

    Software&nbsp;development is a pursuit characterized by complexity. This can take many forms, such as accommodating
    complex requirements, technology, or team dynamics. Elevating the level of abstraction helps you manage this complexity
    and make measurable progress, despite the inherent difficulty of the task.
</p>
<p>
    Suggestions for several strategies that help abstract away complexity follow.
</p>
<h3>
    Leverage patterns
</h3>
<p>
    Patterns help you take advantage of proven techniques for solving common problems. You can benefit from the experience
    of seasoned practitioners and avoid "re-inventing the wheel," as the saying goes. The use of patterns is a crucial
    aspect of an architecture-centric approach to development, because it helps reduce the novelty and diversity of a
    solution, thus improves quality.
</p>
<p>

    guid="_0YJvUMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Concept: Pattern</a>&nbsp;for more information.
</p>
<h3>
    Design the architecture with components and services
</h3>
<p>
    This strategy helps manage software complexity through&nbsp;partitioning&nbsp;a system into a set of loosely coupled
    and highly cohesive components. The benefits of this approach include the ability to organize the team around a set of
    smaller, more manageable objectives, and the ability to substitute parts of the system without disturbing the overall
    cohesion of the system. Exposing services encourages re-use by making the functionality of the system easier to
    comprehend. Focusing on services makes it possible to understand what the system does from a technical perspective
    without necessarily having to understand the details of how the system works.

</p>
<h3>
    Actively promote reuse
</h3>
<p>
    Incorporating existing software into an overall architecture helps reduce cost and improve quality by reusing proven
    working software, rather than developing from scratch. It also helps reduce the burden of maintenance by eliminating
    duplication in the software. Although often difficult to manage, a project or enterprise can reap significant benefits
    from a well-executed re-use strategy.

</p>
<p>
    Business Patterns are often found in COTS products. For example, packaged applications that support Enterprise Resource
    Planning or Customer Relationship Management ship with functionality to support a variety of generic business
    processes. Similarly, it is frequently possible to identify related or similar behavior in the Use
    Case&nbsp;Scenarios&nbsp;and thereby derive generic designs that you can use in the design of the system. These
    elements of generic behavior can be&nbsp;expressed as Design&nbsp;Patterns and applied to the system design.

          <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h4>
    Origins
</h4>
<p>
    The idea of patterns as it is now applied to software design comes from the work of Christopher Alexander. He has
    written widely on the subject of applying patterns to the design and construction of towns and buildings. Two of his
    books, <em>A Pattern Language</em> [<a class="elementLinkWithUserText"
    href="./../../../core.tech.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.tech_6CCF393.html"
    guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">ALE77</a>] and <em>The Timeless Way of Building</em> [<a class="elementLinkWithUserText"
    href="./../../../core.tech.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.tech_6CCF393.html"
    guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">ALE79</a>] have had the greatest impact on the software community and the adoption of
    software patterns for the design of software. His concepts of patterns and pattern language provide a model for the
    capture of software design expertise in a form that can then be reapplied in recurring situations.&nbsp;
</p>
<h4>
    A definition of patterns
</h4>
<p>
    Today, the most commonly used definition of software patterns is from [<a class="elementLinkWithUserText"
    href="./../../../core.tech.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.tech_6CCF393.html"
    guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">GAM95</a>]:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        "A design pattern describes the problem, a solution to the problem consisting of a general arrangement of objects
        and classes, when to apply the solution, and the consequences of applying the solution."
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    This definition often serves only as a starting point, however. A richer definition, based on Alexander's work, is
    offered by Gabriel in his book, <em>A Timeless Way of Hacking</em> [<a class="elementLinkWithUserText"
    href="./../../../core.tech.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.tech_6CCF393.html"
    guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">ALU03</a>], in which each pattern is a three-part rule that expresses relationships
    among a certain context, a certain system of forces that occur repeatedly in that context, and a certain software
    configuration that allows these forces to resolve themselves.
</p>
<h4>
    Describing patterns
</h4>
<p>
    It is commonplace to describe patterns&nbsp;using the&nbsp;format made popular by Erich Gamma and his three colleagues
    [<a class="elementLinkWithUserText"
    href="./../../../core.tech.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.tech_6CCF393.html"
    guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">GAM95</a>]. They have come to be known as the Gang of Four (GoF); therefore, their
    description is known as the <strong>GoF format</strong>. The GoF format uses the following keywords to describe
    object-oriented design patterns:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Pattern name and classification:</strong> Naming the pattern allows design to work at a higher level of
            abstraction, using a vocabulary of patterns. Gamma says that finding a good name is one of the hardest problems
            of developing a catalogue of patterns (see <strong>Pattern catalogues</strong> later in this section).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Intent:</strong> An answer to questions such as: What does the pattern do? What problem does it
            address?
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Also known as:</strong> Other names for the pattern.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Motivation:</strong> A concrete scenario that illustrates a design problem and how the pattern solves
            the problem.
        </p>

    Although the GoF format is specifically intended for object-oriented development, you can use it, with slight
    modification, to address other software patterns. A more general keyword format for software patterns based on
    Alexander's principles uses keywords such as <em>problem</em>, <em>context</em>, <em>forces</em> and <em>solution</em>.

<h4>
    Pattern catalogs
</h4>
<p>
    To assist with the identification and selection of patterns, various classification schemes have been proposed. One of
    the early schemes, proposed by Buschmann and his associates, [<a class="elementLinkWithUserText"
    href="./../../../core.tech.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.tech_6CCF393.html"
    guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">BUS96</a>] uses three classifiers: granularity, functionality, and structured
    principles. Of those three classifiers, it is their granularity classifier that has remained popular. Granularity
    classifies patterns into three levels of abstraction:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Architectural patterns:</strong> Architectural patterns express the fundamental structure of a software
            scheme. Examples of architectural pattern include: layers, pipes and filters, and the model view controller
            pattern.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Design patterns:</strong> Software architecture usually consists of smaller architectural units that
            are described by design patterns. The GoF pattern is an example of a design pattern.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Idioms.</strong> An idiom is the lowest-level pattern, and it is specific to a programming language.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Buschmann and his colleagues introduced four groups for categorizing architectural patterns:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Structure
    </li>
    <li>
        Distributed systems
    </li>
    <li>
        Interactive systems
    </li>
    <li>
        Adaptable systems
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The following table shows the categorization of their architectural patterns.

<p>
    For design patterns, Gamma's group categorized their design patterns by purpose, using three categories:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Creational
    </li>
    <li>
        Structural
    </li>
    <li>
        Behavioral
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Pattern languages
</h4>
<p>
    In addition to the concept of patterns, Alexander also gave the software community the concept of a pattern language.
    The purpose of developing a pattern language was to provide a vocabulary of design principles (patterns) that would
    allow those who work, study, or live in buildings to communicate effectively with the planners and designers of those
    buildings. Alexander explains that when using a pattern language:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        We always use it as a sequence, going through the patterns, moving always from the larger patterns to the smaller,
        always from the ones that create structure to the ones which then embellish those structures, and then to those
        that embellish the embellishments.
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    In applying patterns in this way, Alexander advocated the use of generative pattern languages, ones that, given an
    initial context, would always lead to good design.&nbsp; Alexander&nbsp;states:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        Thus, as in the case of natural languages, the pattern language is generative. It not only tells us the rules of
        arrangement, but shows us how to construct arrangements - as many as we want - which satisfies the rules.
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    In the application of software patterns, pattern names provide a vocabulary for the communication of software ideas.
    The sequential application of patterns finds application in software design processes, both waterfall and iterative,
    that successively apply architectural patterns, and then design patterns, and, finally, idioms to design and implement
    a software system. Software processes, however, rely on the skills of the Architect and Developer roles to guide the
    application of patterns, rather than a generative pattern language.

          <MainDescription><![CDATA[<p>
    Maximizing reuse has always been an important goal of software development. It's better to re-use than to expend the
    cost of creating something new, testing it, and releasing it for the first time with the risk of hidden problems that
    all new software has. Languages, particularly object-oriented ones, have been developed to make reuse easier. But a
    language alone isn't enough to provide cost effective reuse. The bulk of reusable software comes from skilled
    developers and architects who are able to identify and leverage reuse opportunities.
</p>
<h3>
    What is a Reusable Asset?
</h3>
<p>
    The following are some examples of reusable software assets:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Architectural frameworks
    </li>
    <li>
        Architectural mechanisms
    </li>
    <li>
        Architectural decisions
    </li>
    <li>
        Constraints
    </li>
    <li>
        Applications

    <li>
        Components
    </li>
    <li>
        COTS software&nbsp;
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Identifying Reuse Opportunities
</h3>
<p>
    There are three perspectives to look at when reusing software: code (implementation), design, and framework or
    architecture.&nbsp; Architects should look to reuse significant application frameworks such as layers that can be
    applied to many different types of applications (for more information, see <a class="elementLinkWithType"
    href="./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/guidelines/layering_F169CF07.html"
    guid="_0gpkAMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Guideline: Layering</a>. Developers should look to designs and <a class="elementLink"
    href="./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/pattern_10BE6D96.html"
    guid="_0YJvUMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Pattern</a>s that can be reused to produce desired behavior or robust structures. They
    should also look at how to reduce the amount of code that needs to be written by leveraging stable components and code
    that has been proven in production environments.
</p>
<p>
    The best way to enable a team to find opportunities for reuse is to exercise excellent design and coding practices.
    It's difficult to find code and design that can be reused when dealing with large classes, classes that don't have a
    clearly defined focus, or classes with relationships that are difficult to understand. Classes should be small, easy to
    understand, and highly cohesive to make it easier to identify reuse opportunities. Any functionality that can be
    reasonably separated into another class should be. Another way of saying this is that any concept that could be applied
    to more than one type of class should be its own class.
</p>
<p>
    For example, if some calculations are added to an existing class, it may make sense to then refactor those calculations
    into a new helper class. Those calculations can&nbsp;then be re-used in any number of other classes without the burden
    of having to know about the functionality of the original class.
</p>
<p>
    The simplest but least efficient way to identify reuse opportunities is to "smell" similar code. A developer may recall
    doing something similar to what they're designing or implementing now. Once the previous implementation has been
    discovered or recalled it can be reused. Developers will always find reuse opportunities this way. But the unstructured
    nature of it won't maximize the potential areas for reuse.
</p>
<p>
    Collaboration is a good technique for identifying reuse opportunities. It provides a structure where identifying reuse
    - instead of writing code - is the goal of the exercise. And the more brains that are looking for reuse opportunities,
    the more likely it is that they'll be found. A brainstorming or review meeting that focuses on identifying reuse
    opportunities would be useful to support this.
</p>
<p>
    Patterns are good ways to find reuse opportunities in designs and frameworks. See <a class="elementLinkWithType"
    href="./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/pattern_10BE6D96.html"
    guid="_0YJvUMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Concept: Pattern</a>&nbsp;for more information.
</p>
<p>
    Analyzing behavior is another good way to identify potential areas for reuse. Analyze how classes need to collaborate
    in order to deliver some specific functionality such as a requirement or feature. This collaboration can be documented
    in sequence (behavior) and class (structure) diagrams and can be reused in similar circumstances.
</p>
<p>
    After looking for similar behavior and returned values, then look for similarity of parameters. If their
    interfaces&nbsp;are not an exact match for the component interfaces being proposed, you can modify the
    proposed&nbsp;signatures to increase the degree of reuse. Some design mechanisms, such as performance or security
    requirements, may disqualify a component from reuse even when there is&nbsp;a perfect match between operation
    signatures.
</p>
<p align="left">
    A common set of components may exist that provides many of the <a class="elementLink"
    href="./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/arch_mechanism_2932DFB6.html"
    guid="_mzxI0A4LEduibvKwrGxWxA">Architectural Mechanism</a> that you need&nbsp;for the new system. These components may
    be available either because they were developed or purchased previously for&nbsp;similar systems. Given their
    suitability and compatibility within the software architecture, there may be a need to reverse-engineer these
    components to represent them in a design model and reuse them in a project.
</p>
<p align="left">
    Similar thinking applies to&nbsp;existing databases. Part of the information to be used by the application under
    development may already reside in a database. You may be able to get the classes that represent the database structures
    that hold this information by reverse-engineering the database.
</p>
<p>
    <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/refactoring_1B63BA3B.html"
    guid="_Poc7IPDzEdqYgerqi84oCA">Refactoring</a> should always be considered when reusing code. Code (or design) is often
    not originally written for re-use, or reusable code may not be a perfect fit for a new situation.
</p>
<h3>
    Assessing and Selecting Assets to Reuse
</h3>
<p>
    To assess and select assets to reuse on your project, you need to understand the requirements of the system's
    environment. You also need to understand the scope and general functionality of the system that the stakeholders
    require. There are several types of assets to consider, including (but not limited to): reference architectures;
    frameworks; patterns; analysis mechanisms; classes; and experience. You can search asset&nbsp;repositories (internal or
    external to your organization) and industry literature to identify assets or similar projects.
</p>
<p>
    You need to assess whether available assets contribute to solving the key challenges of the current project and whether
    they are compatible with the project's architectural constraints. You also need to analyze the extent of the fit
    between assets and requirements, considering whether any of the requirements are negotiable (to enable use of the
    asset). Also, assess whether the asset could be modified or extended to satisfy requirements, as well as what the
    tradeoffs in adopting it are, in terms of cost, risk, and functionality.
</p>
<p>
    Leverage reuse of existing components by evaluating their interfaces and the behavior that they provide. Reuse
    components when their interfaces are similar or match the interfaces of components you would need to develop from
    scratch. If not similar, modify the newly identified interfaces so you improve the fit with existing components
    interfaces. Work with developers to gain consensus on the suitability of using existing components.
</p>
<p>
    Finally, decide, in principle, whether to use one or more assets, and record the rationale for this decision.
</p>
<h3>
    Reuse Techniques
</h3>
<p>
    Reuse can be performed differently depending on the capabilities of the implementation environment. The simplest
    technique is to copy the code from one place to another. This isn't advisable because it's not really reuse. Multiple
    copies of source code are difficult to maintain and can eventually diverge from each other. Reuse is about using the
    same code to perform similar tasks as a way to increase quality and reduce overhead.
</p>
<p>
    Some languages, such as C++, support templates. Templates, sometimes referred to as parameterized code, are a precursor
    to patterns. Templates are code with parameters that are applied just when the code's needed, at compile time. The C++
    Standard Template Library (STL) is one example. It provides many types of reusable containers (lists, sets, safe
    arrays, etc) that don't have some of the drawbacks of inheritance. Templates such as these are also useful as mix-in
    classes in languages like C++ that support multiple inheritance. Because mix-ins are implemented as templates, they
    allow for a type of multiple inheritance without the baggage.
</p>
<h3>
    Inheritance and Aggregation
</h3>
<p>
    Inheritance (also known as generalization) is an easy way to implement polymorphism and has been used as the primary
    mechanism for reuse in modern object-oriented languages. This is unfortunate, as inheritance imposes a rigid structure
    on the software's design that is difficult to change. Any inheritance hierarchy that shares code from parents to
    children will have problems when it grows to be three or more levels deep. Too many exceptions occur to maintain a pure
    "is-a" relationship between parents and children, where children are always considered to have all the properties and
    behaviors of the parents. Inheritance should be used to share definitions (interfaces), not implementations. Years of
    difficulties with inheriting implementations have made this practice a primary object-oriented design principle.
</p>
<p>
    Whenever inheritance is used, it is best to have only the last child class (leaf node) of the inheritance hierarchy be
    instantiated. All parent classes should be abstract. This is because a class that tries to be both reusable and
    concrete - to provide reusable and specific behavior at the same time - almost always fails to fulfill either goal.
    This is a dimension of cohesiveness. One thing that makes a class cohesive is that it's dedicated to reuse or dedicated
    to a specific implementation, but not both.
</p>
<p>
    Aggregation is a technique that collects or aggregates functionality into larger elements of functionality. It provides
    a structure that's far more flexible and reusable than inheritance. It's better to reuse implementation and design by
    aggregating small pieces of functionality together rather than trying to inherit the functionality from a parent.
</p>
<p>
    You may also find reuse opportunities by reviewing interfaces. If interfaces describe similar behavior it may be
    possible to eliminate one of the interfaces, have just one implementation realize both interfaces, or refactor the
    interfaces to put redundant content in a new, simpler interface.
</p>
<h3>
    Finding Reusable Code
</h3>
<p>
    There are many sources of reusable code beyond what the developers are writing for a specific project. Other places
    from which to harvest code include the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Internal (corporate) code libraries
    </li>
    <li>
        Third party libraries
    </li>
    <li>
        Built-in language libraries
    </li>
    <li>
        Code samples from tutorials, examples, books, etc.
    </li>
    <li>
        Local code guru or knowledgeable colleague
    </li>
    <li>
        Existing system code
    </li>
    <li>
        Open source products (be sure to follow any licensing agreements)
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Also, many tools that generate code will generate comprehensive code based on minimal specification. For example, a
    design tool might generate the member variable plus a get and a set operation when the designer specifies an attribute.
    Other more sophisticated tools with knowledge of a specific framework can generate voluminous code to ensure that a
    class conforms to the framework. An example of this would be a tool that generates significant additional code when a
    class is marked as a Java entity bean. This sort of consistent transformation from a specification (the design) to an
    implementation (the code) could be considered a form of code reuse as well.
</p>
<h3>
    Don't Reuse Everything
</h3>
<p>
    Reuse makes code and design cheap to use but expensive to build. It requires experience and thoughtful consideration to
    create an implementation or design that's abstract enough for others to re-use, but concrete enough to be truly useful.
    Reusable code must also be maintained. Many organizations have difficulty assigning responsibility for maintaining
    reusable code if they don't have a group dedicated to reuse.
</p>
<p>
    It's usually not a good idea to create code or designs for reuse unless you know it's going to be reused. It's better
    to refactor software to be more reusable after it's discovered that they can be reused. One rule of thumb is to write
    for reuse only when you know you'll use it at least 3 times. Otherwise the cost of building and maintaining that part
    of the software will not be recovered by reduced overhead in other areas of development.

    When identifying the elements for a scenario of system behavior, you can align each participating element with one of
    three key perspectives: <b>Entity</b>, <b>Control</b>, or <b>Boundary</b>. Although specifics of languages, frameworks,
    and heuristics of quality design will drive the final design, a first cut that covers required system behavior can
    always be assembled with elements of these three perspectives.
</p>
<p>
    This pattern is similar to the Model View Controller pattern (described here [<a class="elementLinkWithUserText"
    href="./../../../core.tech.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.tech_6CCF393.html#BUS96"
    guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">BUS96</a>] and here [<a class="elementLinkWithUserText"
    href="./../../../core.tech.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.tech_6CCF393.html#WIKP-MVC"
    guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">WIKP-MVC</a>], among other places), but the Entity Control Boundary (ECB) pattern is not
    solely appropriate for dealing with user interfaces, and it gives the controller a slightly different role to play.
</p>
<h4 align="left">
    ECB&nbsp;pattern example

</p>
<h3>
    Entity elements
</h3>
<p>
    An entity is a long-lived, passive element that is responsible for some meaningful chunk of information. This is not to
    say that entities are "data," while other design elements are "function." Entities perform behavior organized around
    some cohesive amount of data.
</p>
<p>
    An example of an entity for a customer service application is a Customer entity that manages all information about a
    customer. A design element for&nbsp;this entity would include data about the customer, behavior to manage the data,
    behavior to validate customer information&nbsp;and to perform other business calculations, such as "Is this customer
    allowed to purchase product X?"
</p>
<p>
    The identification of the entities as part of this pattern can be done many times at different levels of abstraction
    from the code, at different levels of granularity in size, and from the perspectives of different contexts. For
    example, you could do an analysis pass on a scenario of creating a marketing campaign and identify the customer element
    with various customer data elements, such as name and address, plus various required behaviors, such as the management
    of the name and address data and the ability to rate the customer based on some algorithm (such an application of this
    pattern would be abstract from code, coarse-grained, and have no specific context). Later, you could do a pass on the
    same scenario applying an architectural mechanism for database access that breaks the address out as its own element,
    moves the responsibility for storing and retrieving customers to a new control element, and identifies specific
    database decisions, such as the use of primary keys in the entities. (Such an application of this pattern would be
    closer to the code, finer-grained, and aligned with a database&nbsp;context.)
</p>
<h3>
    Control elements
</h3>
<p>
    A control element manages the flow of interaction of the scenario. A control element could manage the end-to-end
    behavior of a scenario or it could manage the interactions between a subset of the elements. Behavior and business
    rules relating to the information relevant to the scenario should be assigned to the entities; the control elements are
    responsible only for the flow of the scenario.
</p>
<p>
    CreateMarketingCampaign is an example of a control element for a customer service application. This design element
    would&nbsp;be responsive to certain front-end boundary elements and would collaborate with other entities,
    control&nbsp;elements, and back-end boundary elements to support the creation of a marketing campaign.
</p>
<p>
    As with the entity example here, there might be many passes over the identification of control elements. A first pass
    might be an analysis pass that identifies one control element for a scenario, with behavior to make sure that the
    design can support the flow of events. A&nbsp;subsequent pass might find controllers to manage reusable collaborations
    of low-level elements that will map to a specific code&nbsp;unit to be written.
</p>
<h3>
    Boundary elements
</h3>
<p>
    A boundary element lies on the periphery of a system or subsystem, but within it. For any scenario being considered
    either across the whole system or within some subsystem, some boundary elements will be "front end" elements that
    accept input from outside of the area under design, and other elements will be "back end," managing communication to
    supporting elements outside of the system or subsystem.
</p>
<p>
    Two examples of boundary elements for a customer service application might be a front end MarketingCampaignForm and a
    back end BudgetSystem element. The MarketingCampaignForm would manage the exchange of information between a user and
    the system, and the BudgetSystem would manage the exchange of information between the system and an external system
    that manages budgets.
</p>
<p>
    If the system communicates with another system (where that system could be anything from software to hardware units
    that the current system will use, such as printers, terminals, alarm devices, and sensors).&nbsp; An analysis pass
    could identify one boundary element for each external relevant to a scenario.
</p>
<p>
    Example:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        An automated teller machine (ATM) must communicate with the ATM network to ascertain whether a customer's bank
        number and PIN are correct, and whether the customer has sufficient funds to withdrawal the requested amount. The
        ATM network is an external system (from the perspective of the ATM); therefore, you would use a
        <strong>boundary</strong> class to represent it in a use-case analysis.
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    Subsequently, these could be broken down into multiple boundary elements or small communities made up of collaborating
    elements of all three stereotypes. If the interfaces with the system are simple and well-defined, a single class may be
    sufficient to represent the external system. Often, however, these interfaces are too complex to be represented by
    using a single class; they often require complex collaborations of many classes. Moreover, interfaces between systems
    are often highly reusable across applications. As a result, in many cases, a component models the system interfaces
    more appropriately.&nbsp; The use of a component allows the interface to the external system to be defined and
    stabilized, while leaving the design details of the system interface hidden as the system evolves.
</p>
<h3>
    Walking through the scenario
</h3>
<p>
    You can walk through a scenario initiated by something outside of the boundaries of the system or subsystem being
    designed and distribute the responsibility to perform behavior supporting the scenario to the elements identified of
    each type. The appropriate design element responsible for each action in the scenario will be as described in the
    definition of each of the element types described here previously.
</p>
<p>
    In addition to identifying the behavior necessary to perform the scenario, the initiation of this behavior from design
    element to design element identifies the necessary relationships. There are certain appropriate relations between the
    participating elements. An element can communicate with other elements of the same kind. Control elements can
    communicate with each of the other two kinds, but entities and boundary elements should not communicate directly.
</p>
<p>
    This table shows appropriate links between design elements.

    Refactoring is a disciplined way to restructure code when small changes are made to the code to improve its design. An
    important aspect of a refactoring is that it improves the design while not changing the behavior of the design; a
    refactoring neither adds nor removes functionality.
</p>
<p>
    Refactoring enables you to evolve the code slowly over time, to take an iterative and incremental approach to
    implementation.
</p>
<p>
    These are the types of refactoring:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Code refactoring. Often referred to simply as refactoring, this is the refactoring of programming source code.
        Examples of code refactorings include Rename Method, Encapsulate Field, Extract Class, Introduce Assertion, and
        Pushdown Method.
    </li>
    <li>
        Database refactoring. A database refactoring is a simple change to a database schema that improves its design while
        retaining both its behavioral and informational semantics. Examples of database refactorings include Rename Column,
        Split Table, Move Method to Database, Replace LOB with Table, Introduce Column Constraint, and Use Official Data
        Source.
    </li>
    <li>
        User interface (UI) refactoring. A UI refactoring is a simple change to the UI which retains its semantics.
        Examples of UI refactorings include Align Entry Fields, Apply Common Button Size, Apply Common Font, Indicate
        Format, Reword in Active Voice, and Increase Color Contrast.
    </li>
</ol>

    Martin Fowler [<a class="elementLinkWithUserText"
    href="./../../../core.tech.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.tech_6CCF393.html#FOW99"
    guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">FOW99</a>] identifies four key reasons to refactor:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Refactoring improves the design of software.
    </li>
    <li>
        Refactoring makes software easier to understand.
    </li>
    <li>
        Refactoring helps you find bugs.
    </li>
    <li>
        Refactoring helps you program faster.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Refactoring can improve the design of existing code, but it does not take the place of considering the design before
    writing code. Refactoring instead changes the role of up-front design, allowing the strictly design work to be more
    abstract. Small-scale, very tactical decisions can be made during the implementation of the solution with confidence
    that refactoring will ensure a quality implementation at that level. The designing of the solution before
    implementation will be more lightweight and focused on broad factors that will drive the implementation.
</p>
<p>
    There is an additional benefit of refactoring: it changes the way a developer thinks about the implementation when not
    refactoring. The basic task of implementing a solution becomes solely about getting the solution to pass its developer
    tests in the simplest way possible. Then the design of that solution can be examined and refactored separately. Even if
    these two things -- implementation of the solution and then improvement -- are just a minute apart, it can be freeing
    for a developer to single-mindedly create code that causes a test to pass, and then separately single-mindedly improve
    that code.

          <MainDescription><![CDATA[<p>
    Layering&nbsp; is&nbsp;one of the most&nbsp;commonly used&nbsp;approaches for structuring and decomposing systems.
    Layering logically partitions the system into sets of components with certain rules regarding how relationships can be
    formed between them. Layering provides a way to restrict inter-subsystem dependencies, with the result that the system
    is more loosely coupled and more easily maintained.
</p>
<p>
    Consider the number and purpose of the layers carefully. Do not over-complicate the solution by defining more layers
    than are needed to meet the needs of the solution. More layers can always be added in the future to meet new
    requirements. Removing layers is not always as easy and may introduce risks into the project.
</p>
<p>
    The criteria for grouping elements into layers follows a few patterns:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Visibility</b><strong>:</strong> Elements may depend only on components in the same layer and the next-lower
        layer.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Volatility</b><strong>:</strong> 
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>In the highest layers</b>, put elements that vary when user requirements change.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>In the lowest layers</b>, put elements that vary when the implementation platform changes (hardware,
                language, operating system, database, and so forth).
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Sandwiched in the middle</strong>, put elements that are generally applicable across wide ranges of
                systems and implementation environments.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Add layers</strong> when additional partitions within these broad categories help to organize the
                model.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Generality</b><strong>:</strong> Abstract elements tend to be placed in the lower layers. If not
        implementation-specific, they tend to gravitate toward the middle layers.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Number of layers.</b> For a small system, three layers are typically sufficient.&nbsp;A three-layer architecture
        of&nbsp;Presentation, Business, and Data layers is very common in information systems.&nbsp; For a complex system,
        five to seven layers could be appropriate. For any degree of complexity, more than 10 layers should be viewed with
        suspicion that increases with the number of layers.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Failure to restrict dependencies according to the visibility criteria mentioned above can cause architectural
    degradation and make the system difficult to extend and maintain.
</p>
<p>
    Allowable exceptions to the visibility rule include cases where components need direct access to lower-layer services
    beyond the next-lower layer. Make a decision about how to handle primitive services that are needed throughout the
    system, such as printing, sending messages, and so forth. There is little value in restricting messages to lower layers
    if the solution is to effectively implement call pass-throughs in the intermediate layers.&nbsp;&nbsp;This usage of a
    less strict rule on dependencies down through the layers is sometimes called a Relaxed Layered Architecture (<a
    class="elementlinkwithusertext"
    href="./../../../core.tech.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.tech_6CCF393.html#BUS96"
    guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">[BUS96]</a>).
</p>
<h4>
    <a id="PartitioningPatterns" name="PartitioningPatterns">Partitioning patterns</a>
</h4>
<p>
    Within the top layers of the system, additional partitioning may help organize the model. The following guidelines for
    partitioning present different issues to consider:
</p>
<p>
    <b>User organization</b><strong>:</strong> Elements may be organized along lines that mirror the organization of
    functionality in the business organization (partitioning occurs along departmental or user role lines). This
    partitioning often occurs early in the design&nbsp;due to&nbsp;an existing enterprise model that is strongly
    partitioned according to the structure of the organization. This pattern usually affects only the top few layers of
    application-specific services and can often disappear as the design evolves.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            Partitioning along user-organization lines can be a good starting point for the model.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            The structure of the user organization is not stable over a long period of time because business
            reorganizations occur; therefore, it is not a good long-term basis for system partitioning. The internal
            organization of the system should enable the system to evolve and be maintained independently of the
            organization of the business that it supports.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <b>Areas of competence and skills:</b> Elements may be organized to partition responsibilities among different groups
    within the development organization. Typically, this occurs in the middle and lower layers of the system, and reflects
    the need for specialization in skills during the development and support of an infrastructure based on complex
    technology. Examples of such technologies include network and distribution management, database management,
    communication management, and process control, among others. Partitioning along competence lines may also occur in
    upper layers, where special competency in the problem domain is required to understand and support key business
    functionality. Examples include telecommunication call management, securities trading, insurance claims processing, and
    air traffic control, to name a few.
</p>
<p>
    <b>System distribution:</b> Within any of the layers of the system, the layers may be further partitioned horizontally,
    so to speak, to reflect the distribution of functionality.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            Partitioning to reflect distribution of functionality can help you visualize the network communication that
            will occur as the system runs.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Partitioning to reflect distribution can also, however, make the system more difficult to change if the
            deployment model changes significantly.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <b>Secrecy areas</b><strong>:</strong> Some applications, especially those requiring special security clearance to
    develop or support, require additional partitioning according to security access privileges. Software that controls
    access to secrecy areas must be developed and maintained by personnel with appropriate clearance. If the number of
    people with this background on the project is limited, the functionality requiring special clearance must be
    partitioned into subsystems that will be developed independently from other subsystems, with the interfaces to the
    secrecy areas the only visible aspect of these subsystems.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Variability areas:</b> Functionality that is likely to be optional, and therefore delivered only in some variants of
    the system, should be organized into independent components that are developed and delivered independently from the
    mandatory functionality of the system.

    Introduction
</h3>
<p>
    This example illustrates how the use-case model and associated use-case specification will evolve during the lifecycle.
    It shows the state of the use case model at two points in the lifecycle: early inception and towards the end of
    elaboration. The purpose is to illustrate how one would identify, outline and detail requirements so as to maximize
    stakeholder value and minimize risk early in the project, as well as to minimize re-work later.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    The example uses an Automated Teller Machine as the example system, because it is familiar to most people. This
    familiarity simplifies understanding the principles without getting lost in domain specific terminology.
</p>
<h4>
    Early inception
</h4>
<p>
    Assume you have just started on the project as the Analyst. You have identified the key stakeholders and met with them
    to discuss their needs. During your meetings, you identified a number of key actors, use cases, and supporting
    requirements for the ATM system. You captured the use cases and actors, with names and brief descriptions only, in the
    use-case model. An example of this work is given in the document <strong>ATM UC Model Inception</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    Prior to committing significant time to detailing these use cases now, you recognize that a "breadth before depth"
    approach can save you valuable time and permit you to identify the highest value and highest risk items so that you can
    concentrate on those first.
</p>
<p>
    You hold a brainstorming session with the stakeholders and outline the basic flow of each of the main use cases. As you
    are working through, you may identify some additional alternative flows. Fight the urge to "dive-in" to the details on
    these alternative flows at this point, simply list them and come back later when you have a better understanding of the
    "big picture".
</p>
<p>
    Examples of the notes you took during this exercise are attached (<strong>Withdraw Cash Outline</strong>,
    <strong>Deposit Funds Outline</strong> and <strong>Transfer</strong> <strong>Funds Outline</strong>).<br />
    <b>Note:</b> the choice of font is intentional to illustrate that these are notes, not formal documents.
</p>
<p>
    Reviewing your notes, you recognize that there is some behavior that is common to most of the use cases, namely the
    steps required to validate the Bank Customer. Factoring this behavior out into an &lt;&lt;included&gt;&gt; use case
    will simplify communications, iteration planning, and maintenance.
</p>
<p>
    You update the use case model accordingly: <strong>ATM UC Model Elaboration</strong>.
</p>
<h4>
    Elaboration
</h4>
<p>
    With a better understanding of the system, you can now prioritize your effort to maximize value and minimize risk. You
    start by detailing the common behavior captured in the use case: Validate User. This use case captures key
    architectural requirements that will exercise a significant portion of the system (communications with the Bank, card
    reader interface, and so on). Implementing this one key scenario will go a long way to reducing risk.
</p>
<p>
    An example of the Validate User use-case specification is attached: <strong>Use Case Spec - Validate User.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Note that there may still be some un-answered questions, but that's OK. Capture these directly in the use-case
    specification and get them answered (see Section 5.6 of the <strong>Validate User UC Specification</strong>, for an
    example).
</p>
<p>
    Continuing with another architecturally significant thread, you detail the basic flow and some key alternative flows of
    the use case: Withdraw Cash. You know that if the team can implement this, much of the other functionality will be low
    risk.
</p>
<p>
    An example of the Withdraw Cash use-case specification is attached:&nbsp;<strong>Use Case Spec - Withdraw
    Cash</strong>.
</p>
<h3>
    Summary
</h3>
<p>
    By following a breadth before depth approach to outlining and detailing use cases, you can make better decisions on
    priorities. Start by identifying actors. Then for each actor, ask "What is the main purpose this actor would like to
    use the system?". This will lead to the identification of the use cases. Capture the actors and use cases in the
    use-case model along with a brief description.
</p>
<p>
    Prioritize the use cases, and then draft the main scenario or basic flow. As you are working through this you may
    identify alternate flows (what can go wrong, what options are available, and so on). Capture these, along with a brief
    description.
</p>
<p>
    Review the use-case model and reprioritize and assess risk. For the high priority (based on value to the stakeholders)
    or high risk use cases,&nbsp;detail the main scenario and the critical alternate flows.
</p>
<p>
    If you follow this approach, you will increase the likelihood of delivering value early, minimizing risk, and
    minimizing re-work.<br />

    1 Introduction
</h3>
<p>
    This is an example of a Use-Case Model as it would appear in Elaboration. Primary actors and use cases are identified,
    and key scenarios (those that will be implemented first) are detailed. Each use case has an associated use-case
    specification.
</p>
<h3>
    2 Overview
</h3>
<p>
    The Automated Teller Machine is a remote unit connected to the bank computer systems. The purpose of the system is to
    bring regular bank services closer to the customer and increase the working hours to around the clock. It is also
    important to decrease the amount of bank cashiers. An ATM withdrawal is less expensive for the Bank than a withdrawal
    from a teller.<br />
    <br />
    The ATM system requires that each bank customer has an ATM card and remembers his PIN code. The whole security of this
    system builds on the PIN code.

    1 Brief Description
</h3>
<p>
    This use case describes general behavior for the ATM to validate the user. It includes all steps that are the same no
    matter what kind of transaction the Bank Customer does.
</p>
<h3>
    2 Actors
</h3>
<h4>
    2.1 Bank Customer
</h4>
<h4>
    2.2 Bank
</h4>
<h3>
    3 Preconditions
</h3>
<p>
    There is an active network connection to the Bank.
</p>
<h3>
    4 Basic Flow of Events
</h3>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <p>
        1. The use case begins when the Bank Customer inserts their Bank Card.
    </p>
    <p>
        2. The ATM reads the code from the magnetic strip of the Bank Card and checks with the Bank to see if it is an
        acceptable Bank Card. The Bank confirms the card is valid.
    </p>
    <p>
        3. The ATM asks for the customer PIN code (4 digits).
    </p>
    <p>
        4. The Bank Customer enters a PIN.
    </p>
    <p>
        5. The ATM validates the PIN with the Bank. The Bank confirms the PIN is valid.
    </p>
    <p>
        6. The ATM displays the different alternatives that are available on this unit.
    </p>
    <p>
        7. The use case ends. (The flow continues according to the flow of the specific transaction).
    </p>
</blockquote>
<h3>
    5 Alternative Flows
</h3>
<h4>
    5.1 Not a valid card
</h4>
<p>
    If in step 2 of the basic flow the card is invalid, then
</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <p>
        1. The ATM shall display a "sorry not a valid card" message and return the card.
    </p>
    <p>
        2. The use case ends with an indication of the failure.
    </p>
</blockquote>
<h4>
    5.2 Wrong PIN (1st and 2nd time)
</h4>
<p>
    If in step 5 of the basic flow the PIN is invalid, then
</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <p>
        1. The ATM shall display a "sorry invalid PIN" message.
    </p>
    <p>
        2. The use case resumes at step 3.
    </p>
</blockquote>
<h4>
    5.3 Wrong PIN (third time)
</h4>
<p>
    If in step 5 of the basic flow an incorrect PIN is entered for the third time, then
</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <p>
        1. The ATM shall display a "sorry invalid PIN – Please contact your branch" message.
    </p>
    <p>
        2. The card is kept by the ATM and a receipt is printed telling how and where to get a new card.
    </p>
    <p>
        3. The use case ends with an indication of the failure.
    </p>
</blockquote>
<h4>
    5.4 No Response from Bank
</h4>
<p>
    If in steps 2 or 5 of the basic flow there is no response from the Bank within 3 seconds, then
</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <p>
        1. The ATM will re-try, up to three times.
    </p>
    <p>
        2. If there is still no response from the Bank, the ATM shall display the message "Network unavailable – try again
        later".
    </p>
    <p>
        3. The ATM shall return the card.
    </p>
    <p>
        4. The ATM shall indicate that it is "Closed".
    </p>
    <p>
        5. The use case ends with an indication of the failure.
    </p>
</blockquote>
<h4>
    5.5 No Response from Bank Customer
</h4>
<p>
    If in step 4 of the basic flow there is no response from the Bank Customer within 15 seconds, then
</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <p>
        1. The ATM shall issue a warning sound and display the message "Please enter PIN".<br />
        <br />
        2. If there is still no response from the Bank Customer within 15 seconds the ATM will store the card internally.
    </p>
    <p>
        3. The use case ends with an indication of the failure.
    </p>
</blockquote>
<h4>
    5.6 Stolen Card
</h4>
<p>
    If in step 2, the Bank indicates that this is a stolen card, then
</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <p>
        1. What shall we do? Take a picture of the user? Notify the police?
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    [This is a typical way to use Use Cases. You can write your questions right down in the text ­ and when you get your
    answers you'll have to correct it. Another way to do it: is to assume one way ­ either they like it or they tell you
    how it should be]
</p>
<h3>
    6 Post-conditions
</h3>
<h4>
    6.1 Successful Completion
</h4>
<p>
    If the use case ends in success, the user is validated and may continue with the specific transaction.
</p>
<h4>
    6.2 Failure Condition
</h4>
<p>
    If there is a failure to validate the user, the ATM shall log the event including the reason for the failure.
</p>

            <MainDescription><![CDATA[<p>
    The iteration burndown report is the primary tool for understanding the status of the current iteration. It shows the
    trend for how much work is left to do within the iteration. This is accomplished by adding the estimated effort left
    for each of the work items to be addressed within the iteration, and showing how the estimated effort is changing over
    the duration of the iteration. The iteration backlog should be updated frequently, preferably daily.
</p>
<p>
    These factors affect the team's assessment of how much work remains:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Work that has been completed, which means there is less work remaining
    </li>
    <li>
        The developer responsible for a work item changes the assessment of effort required to complete the work item. This
        should be expected, because you typically understand what it really takes to complete a task after you have done a
        subset of the task. It is common for estimates of the work remaining to increase in the beginning of the iteration,
        especially for inexperienced teams, because they often underestimate efforts. Expect estimates to continue changing
        as teams become more experienced, but the modifications are upward as often as downward.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Daily or frequent updates of the iteration burndown report allow the team to react to changes. For example, changes can
    include cutting the project scope by removing work items from the iteration, reducing the ambition level associated
    with a work item, or finding better ways of approaching work items (such as having an expert team member help with
    difficult work items).

    The best way to read this practice is to first familiarize yourself with its overall structure: what it is in it, and&#xD;
    how it is organized.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Begin by making sure that the teams, including stakeholders, understand what the key concepts are, such as:&#xD;

        The &lt;b>project manager&lt;/b> facilitates the planning of the project iterations, coordinates interactions with the&#xD;
        stakeholders, and keeps the project team focused on meeting the project objectives.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Stakeholders&lt;/b> help the project manager and the team on requirements prioritization in order to minimize&#xD;
        project risks and maximize business value throughout the iterations. Their constant feedback also directs and&#xD;
        improves the quality of the project outcome.&#xD;

    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The &lt;b>team&lt;/b> commits to completing the work within each iteration.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    Understand how these groups collaborate when they perform the following tasks:&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    Today's software applications are too complex to allow you to sequentially define the requirements, come up with an&#xD;
    architecture and design, do an implementation, carry out testing, and get it all right. Whether you use waterfall or&#xD;
    iterative development approaches, your initial requirements, architecture, design, and code will be suboptimal. With&#xD;
    waterfall development, you typically do not get meaningful feedback on what improvements can be made until it is so&#xD;
    late in the project that it is too costly to make them. By contrast, dividing the project into a series of time-boxed&#xD;
    iterations allows you to deliver capabilities that can be assessed by stakeholders at the end of each iteration. This&#xD;
    approach provides rapid and timely feedback loops enabling issues to be addressed and improvements made at a lower cost&#xD;
    while budget and time still allow, and before the project has gone so far ahead that major rework is required.&#xD;
&lt;/p></Problem>

    Iterations&nbsp;keep the team focused on delivering incremental customer value every few weeks by delivering a fully
    tested, demonstrable or shippable build (product increment). This creates a healthy focus on ensuring that whatever is
    worked on is of value to the stakeholders. Decision making must happen faster than in a process without iterations,
    because there is no time for endless debate. Iterative development focuses on producing working code, reducing the risk
    of analysis-paralysis. Frequent demonstration of working code provides feedback mechanisms that allow course
    corrections to be taken as needed.
</p>
<p>
    Iteration planning, estimation, and progress tracking are centered on work items. The iteration plan is created by
    selecting the top-priority work items. Agile estimation techniques are used to understand how many work items can
    safely fit within the time-boxed iteration, and work items are filtered to ensure that the chosen work items will allow
    the team to deliver upon iteration objectives agreed to by stakeholders. Progress is demonstrated through continuous
    completion of many small work items (see <a class="elementLink"
    href="./../../../practice.mgmt.iterative_dev.base/guidances/concepts/micro_increments_C8773066.html"
    guid="_S80VwCNbEdyCq8v2ZO4QcA">Micro-Increments</a>).
</p>
<p>
    Just as a project goes through a lifecycle, iterations go through a lifecycle with a different focus for the team,
    depending on whether you are in the first or the last week of the iteration (see Figure 1 below). An iteration starts
    with an iteration planning meeting that is a few hours long. The initial one or two days are typically focused on
    further planning and architecture to, among other things, understand the dependencies and logical ordering of work
    items, and the architectural impacts of the work to be done. Most of the time during an iteration is spent on executing
    the micro increments. Each micro increment should deliver tested code to a build, as well as validated artifacts. To
    give additional discipline, stable builds are produced at the end of each week. More attention is spent on these builds
    to make sure that the quality is not eroding, and issues are dealt with early so that the success of the iteration
    isn't jeopardized. The last week or last few days of the iteration typically have a stronger emphasis on polishing and
    bug fixing than earlier weeks, even though new features are added as appropriate. The goal is to never let quality
    erode, thus ensuring&nbsp;that a high-quality useful product increment is produced at the end of the iteration. The
    iteration ends with an assessment (with stakeholders) of what was built, and a retrospective to understand how to
    improve the process for next iteration.

          <MainDescription><![CDATA[<p>
    Personal contribution on an&nbsp;iterative project is organized in <strong>micro-increments</strong>. A micro-increment
    represents the outcome of a few hours to a few days of work for one person (or typically a few people collaborating) to
    reach the goals of the iteration. The concept of a micro-increment helps the individual team member to partition their
    work into small units, each of which delivers something of measurable value to the team. Micro-increments provide an
    extremely short feedback loop that drives adaptive decisions within each iteration.
</p>
<p>
    A micro-increment should be well-defined, and you should be able to track daily progress of each micro-increment.
    Micro-increments are specified and tracked by a work item. Change sets represent the physical outcome in terms of the
    files that are modified as a part of completing the work item. Let's have a look at some sample micro-increments:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Identify stakeholders<em>.</em></b> Defining a shared vision is a task that can drag on for weeks, so to ensure
        that you make and track daily progress, divide the task into small and well-defined micro-increments. Describing
        and getting buy-in on which stakeholders to put into a Vision document is a meaningful result, and may take a few
        hours or at most a few days, and thus represents a suitable micro-increment.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Develop Solution Increment.</b> Defining, designing, implementing, and testing a use case or even a scenario can
        take weeks or longer. To ensure continuous progress, divide the work into smaller increments, each of which can be
        done in a couple of days. A more suitable micro-increment may be to only define, design, implement, and test a
        subflow of a use-case or step within a scenario.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Agree on Technical Approach for Persistency.</b> Agreeing on your technical solution may take quite some time,
        so you need to narrow the task to something that can be defined and agreed to in a short time. One way to partition
        the work is according to the issues that you need to resolve, such as persistency or reporting. This
        micro-increment will probably involve defining requirements, surveying available assets, prototyping, and
        documenting the decisions.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Plan Iteration.</b> This micro-increment could include setting up a meeting for creating the iteration plan,
        doing some preparation for the meeting (such as reviewing candidate work items), coaching the team through the
        iteration planning meeting, and posting the iteration plan for easy access. The end result is something complete
        and measurable, a posted plan that has buy-in from the team.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Your project evolves in micro-increments through simultaneous execution of a number of work items. By openly sharing
    progress on your micro-increments through daily team meetings and team collaboration tools, you achieve the
    transparency and insight into each other's work required for effective teamwork. At the same time, you demonstrate
    continuous progress by evolving your application one micro-increment at a time.
</p>
<p>
    Typically,&nbsp;practices&nbsp;provide a set of activities to be performed. Each activity is captured as a set of
    tasks, steps within tasks, and guidance. Even though micro-increments are not explicit constructs in the practices,
    within the activities you will find descriptions of how to carry out a set of related micro-increments that are
    commonly found in projects.&nbsp;This guidance does&nbsp;not provide a complete description of all potential
    micro-increments:&nbsp;each organization should consider adding their own "recipes" for commonly occurring
    micro-increments.

    Retrospectives, as applied in software development, have historical roots in Project Retrospectives described as:
</p>
<blockquote>
    "A ritual held <b>at the end</b> of a project to learn from the experience and plan changes for the next effort." [<a
    class="elementLinkWithUserText"
    href="./../../../core.tech.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.tech_6CCF393.html#KER01"
    guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">KER01</a>]
</blockquote>
<p>
    While Retrospectives conducted at the end of a project remain valuable, the spirit of Retrospectives should be imbued
    across the project continuum, conducted at key project milestones:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        At the end of project iterations
    </li>
    <li>
        After releases
    </li>
    <li>
        Immediately upon occurrences of key project incidents (significant unexpected events).
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    When the practice of Retrospectives is intimately intertwined with the processes of the project, the health of the team
    is constantly monitored, the "heartbeat" of project progress is readily measured, and the team hones an awareness of
    opportunities for improvement and increased productivity. A symbiotic relationship emerges between an evolutionary
    development process and a Retrospective that supports the various methods of inspection and adaptation.
</p>
<p>
    The iteration, incident, and project Retrospectives are designed, in part, to calibrate the team's progress with the
    goals of the project. Several methods can be used to incite the Retrospective team to begin their collective
    investigative work, such as posing the following three driving questions to the team:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        "What worked well for us during the past iteration (or project, and so on)?"
    </li>
    <li>
        "What did not work well for us during the past iteration (or project, and so on)?"
    </li>
    <li>
        "What should we do differently, or what improvements should we undertake during our next iteration (or project, and
        so on)".
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The questions are expected to generate actions that will assist the team in prioritizing suggested improvements for the
    project, to be implemented during the subsequent cycle. In addition to the aforementioned investigative questions, a
    Retrospective should include steps that provide structure for the team's focus and resulting work.
</p>
<p>
    An effectively facilitated Retrospective will create an environment that is conducive to various practices of
    inspection and adaptation. The methods of inspection and adaptation are project control mechanisms that assume, and
    respond to, the existence of complexity, unpredictability, and constant change. Practiced in the context of a
    Retrospective, the methods of inspection and adaptation produce a feedback loop from which flexibility, responsiveness,
    and reliability are realized.
</p>
<p>
    The mere execution of Retrospectives is insufficient without an organizational commitment to a collaborative culture.
    The success of Retrospectives is directly proportional to, and necessarily contingent on, an environment that engenders
    highly motivated and performing teams (not the individual), nurtures open and frequent communication, and provides a
    thriving sense of dedication to the team community. Retrospectives embody the spirit of team collaboration and
    self-reflection by offering an environment in which teams are encouraged to provide feedback and identify lessons
    learned. The compositional aspects of the team are crucial in supporting the highly collaborative nature of
    Retrospectives, enabling the team to produce insight(s) into improving the processes of the project.

          <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h3>
    Participants and facilitator
</h3>
<p>
    The participants that gather in the context of a Retrospective constitute more than a "working group". The participants
    should be thought of as "a small number of people with complementary skills who are committed to a common purpose,
    performance goals, and approach for which they hold themselves mutually accountable." [<a
    class="elementLinkWithUserText"
    href="./../../../core.tech.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.tech_6CCF393.html#KAT93"
    guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">KAT93</a>]
</p>
<p>
    The participants should consist of individuals representing cross-functional groups, having been involved in the
    project period or project incident for which the Retrospective will be conducted. The size of the team is important,
    for the rigorously participative environment of the Retrospective may be difficult to achieve with an overwhelmingly
    large group (25+ individuals), and a set period of time in which to conduct the Retrospective. Conversely, a small set
    of participants that is under-represented by the appropriate functional groups will limit the benefits and productivity
    of team collaboration and self-organization. Although a Retrospective achieves productive results by actualizing team
    responsibility and self-organization, and opposing traditional imposed authority, the work conducted in a Retrospective
    (involving the members of cross-functional groups) demands the presence of a designated facilitator.
</p>
<p>
    The individual that is designated to assume the role of facilitator, or Retrospective leader, should possess
    fundamental skills of a facilitative management approach:
</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <p class="quote">
        "A facilitator is an individual who enables groups and organizations to work more effectively; to collaborate and
        achieve synergy. She or he is a "content-neutral" party who by not taking sides or expressing or advocating a point
        of view during the meeting, can advocate for fair, open, and inclusive procedures to accomplish the group's work. A
        facilitator can also be a learning or dialogue guide to assist a group in thinking deeply about its assumptions,
        beliefs and values and about its systemic processes and context." [<a class="elementLinkWithUserText"
        href="./../../../core.tech.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.tech_6CCF393.html#KAN07"
        guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">KAN07</a>]
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    The facilitator can be expected to allow the participants to exercise a sense of ownership in the operating mode of
    thought, act to remove impediments to the team's effort to reach targeted goals, foster an environment of trust and
    thriving collaboration, and support the team in a manner that allows the team to achieve its best thinking. Ultimately,
    the facilitator focuses on managing the format of the Retrospective, while the participants hone their skills in
    managing the Retrospective content and maintaining a high-performance, participatory group dynamic.
</p>
<h3>
    Establish norms and agreements
</h3>
<p>
    Begin the Project Retrospective by establishing the duration, goals, and expectations of the session. The following are
    typical durations for various Retrospectives:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Iteration:</b> 2 to 4 hours
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Incident:</b> 15 to 45 minutes
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Project:</b> 1 to several days
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Select the facilitator of the Retrospective.
</p>
<p>
    If the team is gathering to conduct the first Retrospective, the group will need to create the cultural norms that will
    be used in the future Retrospectives. If the team is regrouping to conduct a Retrospective, the existing cultural norms
    will be used. Norm Kerth's Prime Directive is an excellent and widely referenced guiding principle for each
    Retrospective:
</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <p class="quote">
        <strong>Prime Directive</strong>: "Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone

<p>
    Remind the team that the Prime Directive and cultural norms of the Retrospective are in place to establish an
    environment in which the members can safely expose sensitive topics and manage meaningful, if provocative, dialogue.
    The cultural norms guide the team by a "social contract" that clearly outlines the <i>team values and working
    agreements</i> that have been established by the team. The social contract needs to include organizational value
    statements that govern acceptable behavior and interactions, supplemented by inviolable principles that govern the
    conduct and ethics of the team. The team must establish these rules of group engagement before the Retrospective
    continues to the core of the group's intended gathering. Examples of working agreements include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Tardiness is not acceptable
    </li>
    <li>
        Mobile phones must be powered off during the session
    </li>
    <li>
        All participants must be in attendance throughout the duration of the Retrospective or ask permission from the
        group for early departure
    </li>
    <li>
        All opinions are welcome
    </li>
    <li>
        The team must strive for healthy, high-quality interaction
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The team's working agreements (and&nbsp;the Prime Directive statement) should be displayed prominently in the
    Retrospective session, so that they are clearly visible to all members of the team and, if required, easily accessible
    so that the team can edit the content. After it is defined, future Retrospectives can begin with a review of these
    working agreements.
</p>
<p>
    After the team has established a safe environment in which to conduct the Retrospective, the facilitator of the
    Retrospective should elicit participation from the group, thereby granting tacit permission to members who are hesitant
    to participate immediately.
</p>
<h3>
    Collect and analyze data
</h3>
<p>
    The team begins this step of the Retrospective with a review of the meaningful characteristics of the iteration,
    release, incident, or project period. The focus of the team's work in this step includes:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Critical developments,
    </li>
    <li>
        Notable discoveries
    </li>
    <li>
        Work completed
    </li>
    <li>
        Project metrics (velocity, number of defects, and so forth)
    </li>
    <li>
        Review of project artifacts (requirements artifacts, project plans, and such)
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Encourage the team to capture all information (project data, opinions, and so on) by using various tools (white boards,
    charts, timelines) that provide a visual representation, so that the team can identify relationships and emerging
    patterns.
</p>
<p>
    The team uses guiding questions to collect and analyze meaningful project data. You can use these examples of key
    questions to elicit relevant information:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Were the defined goals and objectives met? Did the release meet its functionality and quality goals? Did the
        release meet performance and capacity goals?
    </li>
    <li>
        Were risks reduced or eliminated? Can we identify new risks?
    </li>
    <li>
        Were all planned work items addressed? What was the team's velocity relative to the plan?
    </li>
    <li>
        Did the end users provide favorable feedback on what we built in this iteration?
    </li>
    <li>
        Are changes to the project plan required?
    </li>
    <li>
        What portion of the current release will be used to establish the baseline? What portion will need to be reworked?
    </li>
    <li>
        Have there been external changes, such as changes in the marketplace, in the user community, or in the
        requirements?
    </li>
    <li>
        Was the development process appropriate? How can it be fine-tuned for the specific needs of this project?
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The team has generated a list of candidate topics to focus on for its collective inquiry, or heightened analysis. The
    team's methods of analysis need to facilitate a deepening understanding of the events characterizing the iteration,
    incident, release, or Project Retrospective. The team will be evaluating these driving factors, which ultimately
    documents a roadmap for the next cycle:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Success:</b> "What worked well for us during the past iteration (or project or phase)?"
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Failure:</b> "What did not work well for us during the past iteration [or project or phase)?"
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Opportunities for improvement:</b> "What should we do differently, or what improvements should we undertake
        during our next iteration (or project or phase)?"
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    With increasing emphasis, the thread of team collaboration continues throughout the Retrospective, thereby fostering an
    environment conducive to candid, unimpeded examination by the team: a rigorous style of examination that will be
    required to unearth the details lurking in the interactions of the team, the conditions of the project, fortuitous
    events, failures, risks, and examples of flourishing success.
</p>
<p>
    After the team has collected and analyzed the key data in the Retrospective, the team will have evaluated key project
    content. For each item evaluated, they will have established a root cause. The team will know what worked well, what
    did not, and what to do differently this time, so that they can carry forward a list of suggested improvements that
    will be prioritized by the team.
</p>
<h3>
    Set priorities
</h3>
<p>
    By referencing the project data collected and analyzed in the Retrospective, the team now creates a list of suggested
    improvements, assigning a priority to each item on the list.
</p>
<p>
    The selection of improvements should be limited to a subset that will be applied in the next iteration cycle. This list
    should be considered as input to update the next Iteration Plan, so that you can ensure an integrated relationship
    between the changes identified in the Retrospective and the normal course of the team's work plans.
</p>
<p>
    Get commitment from members to complete, the suggested improvements that have been chosen for application in the next
    iteration cycle. The visibility and commitment among the members of the team imbue a sense that the Retrospective was
    worthy of the team's investment of time, and that the results of the work on the Retrospective will be tracked in the
    next iteration cycle.
</p>
<p>
    Maintain a backlog of the suggested improvements that were not chosen for the next iteration cycle. This will preserve
    the work of the Retrospective. The selected content will be available for convenient access and monitoring for
    progress, and the unselected items will be available for consideration during future iteration cycles.
</p>
<h3>
    Conclude and document the process
</h3>
<p>
    The team's honed methods of investigation and analysis&nbsp;are now applied to the Retrospective itself. During the
    evaluation of the Retrospective, the team considers the moments of empowering thought and interaction, considers ideas
    for improving future Retrospectives, revisits the team's social contract, extends appreciation throughout the group,
    and preserves the discoveries of the team (for example,&nbsp;through the use of Retrospective documentation,
    or&nbsp;pictures from a digital camera taken during the Retrospective).

    Practice
</h3>An iteration assessment is a short meeting (up to 4 hours) involving the team and stakeholders.&nbsp;The solution
increment is used as the focal point for brainstorming, and&nbsp;for considering what functionality might be added in the
next Iteration. It is a low ceremony meeting, so the team should not waste too much time preparing the demo and formal
presentations. Preparations can, instead, be focused on making the demo fast-paced, and thinking about a good story to
present the scenarios planned for the demo [<a class="elementLinkWithUserText"
href="./../../../core.tech.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.tech_6CCF393.html#STZ07"
guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">STZ07</a>].<br />
<br />
The team should start the meeting by reviewing the iteration goal before presenting&nbsp;the functionality. The demo should
be kept at a business-oriented level, leaving out the technical details. It should be focused on what was
accomplished&nbsp;rather than how it was done. If possible, the audience should try to use the product. Minor bug fixes and
trivial features should not be demonstrated, but just mentioned, because the audience&nbsp;may lose focus on more important
scenarios. Functionality that isn't <span style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: rgb(255,255,255)">really completed (acceptance
tested)</span>&nbsp;should not&nbsp;be presented. <br />
<br />
Team members present the system functionality and answer stakeholders' questions. They also record changes, missing
functionality, and&nbsp;ideas for new features in the work item list. At the end of the presentation, the stakeholders are
asked for their impressions and the priority of the changes. The potential rearrangement of the <a class="elementLink"
href="./../../../core.mgmt.slot.base/workproducts/project_work_slot_F12BAC46.html" guid="_1QZI8EfUEdyiPI8btkmvmw">[Project
Work]</a> is discussed with the team. Other points of discussion may include: 
<ul>
    <li>
        Were the defined goals and objectives met? Did the release meet its functionality and quality goals? Did the
        release meet performance and capacity goals?
    </li>
    <li>
        Were risks reduced or eliminated?&nbsp;Were new risks&nbsp;identified?
    </li>
    <li>
        Were all planned work items addressed? What was the team's velocity relative to plan?
    </li>
    <li>
        Did the end-users provide favorable feedback on what was built in this iteration?
    </li>
    <li>
        Are any changes to the project plan required?
    </li>
    <li>
        What portion of the current release will be baselined? What portion will need to be reworked?
    </li>
    <li>
        Have there been external changes (such as changes in the marketplace, in the user community, or in the
        requirements) that will affect the project plan?
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    stakeholders and the team may also agree that there is sufficient functionality in the system to provide immediate
    business value, and they may decide to put the solution into production. In that case, discuss what deployment-related
    work items should be added to the <a class="elementLink"

<h3>
    Value
</h3>
<p>
    Iteration assessments provide an opportunity for everybody to learn about the solution being built, and obtain vital
    feedback from stakeholders. It also forces the team to actually finish work and release it.

          <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h3>
    What is prioritized?
</h3>
<p>
    Prioritization should happen for work items, such as enhancement requests,&nbsp;requirements, defects, project tasks,
    and so on. The work items list provides one place for prioritizing work. Prioritizing units of work that are too small
    may lead to analysis-paralysis.
</p>
<h3>
    Who prioritizes?
</h3>
<p>
    Prioritization is done by the extended team. Here are some examples on how different team members contribute to the
    prioritization:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Analysts&nbsp;collaborate with stakeholders to establish the initial priorities for work items to implement, such
        as features, use cases, and scenarios.
    </li>
    <li>
        Architects&nbsp;collaborate with stakeholders and the development team to identify the architecturally significant
        use cases and scenarios, and re-prioritize these so that the team understands what needs to be done to drive down
        technical risk, and&nbsp;to make progress&nbsp;on&nbsp;evolving the product in a technically sensible fashion.
    </li>
    <li>
        Developers&nbsp;and&nbsp;testers help define&nbsp;(but do not decide) the priorities of defects relative to
        achieving iteration objectives.
    </li>
    <li>
        Project managers facilitate (but do not decide), driving convergence on what the team should focus on when planning
        a project, planning an iteration, and managing an iteration. They do this in order to ensure smooth execution, and
        that the perspectives of all team members are properly heard. When the team cannot gain consensus in a reasonable
        time, the project manager has final say on the priority of work items that are too small to warrant the attention
        of the paying stakeholders.
    </li>
    <li>
        stakeholders&nbsp;that pay for the application have the final say on what capabilities to prioritize.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    When do you prioritize?
</h3>
<p>
    When you&nbsp;enter a new work item in&nbsp;the Work Items List, give it an initial priority. Priorities are always
    changing. The sections below describe what re-prioritization is done when you are planning a project, planning an
    iteration,&nbsp;or managing an iteration.
</p>
<h4>
    Prioritizing when planning a project
</h4>
<p>
    During project planning,&nbsp;prioritize the key features, use cases, and scenarios. Also, potentially assign them
    to&nbsp;iterations as a part of laying out the project plan, by defining at a high level what should be done when.
    These priorities will be revised later on as iterations are planned.
</p>
<p>
    When starting a project where an existing application will be enhanced,&nbsp;a Work Items List may exist from past
    projects and usage of the application. If this is the case,&nbsp;go through the Work Items List to survey and
    re-prioritize existing work items, so&nbsp;that the team understands what to focus on.
</p>
<h4>
    Prioritizing when planning an iteration
</h4>
<p>
    When planning what to deliver for an iteration,&nbsp;the team needs to balance what delivers immediate value to the
    stakeholders with what risks need to be mitigated.The chosen balance should be reflected in the iteration objectives,
    which then drive further prioritization and assignments of work items to the next iteration. This exercise should be
    done by the entire team to reflect all of the key perspectives, such as technical ("doing task A before task B saves
    you time"), managerial ("we do not have anybody that knows that legacy application until next iteration", or business
    ("this scenario is more important than that scenario").
</p>
<h4>
    Prioritizing when managing an iteration
</h4>
<p>
    The recommendation is not to&nbsp;expand or change the scope of an iteration, because this will almost certainly lead
    to scope creep, as well as potential confusion among the team on what to work on. As new features and enhancements are
    requested, capture them in the Work Items List, but do not assign them to the current iteration.
</p>
<p>
    During an iteration, you are developing and testing code. As you develop solution increments, you will find defects. In
    most cases, you will directly fix trivial&nbsp;defects as you find them during development. Examples of such defects
    are the many problems you find as you implement your code (for example, using a test-driven development approach or
    doing your regular unit tests). In other cases, the defect should be captured as a work item. This allows it to be
    prioritized, and potentially developed by somebody else or at a different time. If a defect needs to be addressed to
    provide an iteration build of reasonable quality&nbsp;and that&nbsp;aligns with the&nbsp;iteration objectives,&nbsp;the
    defect&nbsp;should be&nbsp;fixed&nbsp;during the current iteration. Note that this is not a creep or change of scope,
    since it merely indicates that something needs to be fixed to deliver what&nbsp;the team&nbsp;already committed to.
</p>
<h3>
    How do you prioritize?
</h3>
<p>
    Prioritizing is the difficult balancing of frequently competing priorities. For more information on the art of
    prioritizing, see for example [<a class="elementLinkWithUserText"

    Towards the end of the iteration, the team jointly assesses whether the objectives and evaluation criteria established&#xD;
    in the Iteration Plan were met, and whether the team adhered to the plan and completed all of the work items committed&#xD;
    to the iteration. The team makes use of objective measures to the greatest extent possible. To assess that a given work&#xD;
    item is completed, the team ensures that the corresponding test cases were successfully run against it.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    Continuously monitor the iteration to ensure that it is progressing appropriately. Track the progress of the current&#xD;
    iteration by maintaining visibility on the status of the items that are being worked on during the iteration. In&#xD;
    particular, it is important to be able to understand how quickly the team is moving through the work scheduled for the&#xD;
    iteration, and how accurate the estimates were &lt;a class=&quot;elementlinkwithusertext&quot;&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Share information about the progress being made by having quick, frequent meetings with the entire project team. These&#xD;
    meetings are useful to understand what team members have accomplished since the last meeting, and what they plan to&#xD;
    accomplish before the next meeting. It also allows the team to identify any blocking issues. See &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Track the status of each work item by using visual indicators of state information (for example: defined, completed,&#xD;
    accepted) in a wall or automated tool. Since iterations are typically fixed in duration, another primary way to gauge&#xD;
    progress is to continuously monitor current status and also estimate how much work remains. Plot an iteration burndown&#xD;
    chart on a daily basis in order to visualize progress on a given iteration. This chart is plotted with the total&#xD;
    estimates for all the items that are not yet started and the estimated remaining effort for any item in progress. See&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;

    Take corrective actions to adjust the course of the iteration if the burndown chart shows that the work will not be&#xD;
    finished as planned.&#xD;

            <Description>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Because outside stakeholders do not participate in the daily activities of the team, it is important that the status of&#xD;
    the project should be communicated to them as often as possible. This communication significantly lowers the risk of&#xD;
    disconnect between the development team and the stakeholders. The status provides the team with data they can use to&#xD;
    improve their development process.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Besides the iteration status, the overall project status can be captured and communicated in a burndown report for the&#xD;
    whole project. This report should show the progress toward the release date, and should be updated at the end of every&#xD;
    iteration (when metrics, such as the team's velocity, can also be provided). This allows the team to predict what it&#xD;
    can accomplish on the remaining project iterations. Other metrics (such as number of test cases passed) can also be&#xD;
    used to present iteration and project status.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Keep the status information visible to stakeholders and the project team at all times in a project workspace (walls or&#xD;
    automated tool), where stakeholders can come and experience first-hand the progress being made by the team.&#xD;

          <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h3>
    Introduction
</h3>
<p>
    The goal with iteration planning is to establish a few high-level objectives for what to accomplish during the
    iteration, produce a sufficiently detailed plan outlining who needs to do what to accomplish those objectives, and
    define how to assess that you accomplished what you set out to accomplish.
</p>
<p>
    Iteration planning is ideally done with the entire team (including key stakeholders) in a meeting (typically lasting
    one to a few hours), at the beginning of an iteration. This ensures that the entire team understands what needs to be
    done, and they become committed to the success of the team. In some cases, it is preferred to have a smaller subset of
    people (such as the Project Manager, an Architect, and an Analyst) to meet in advance to prepare the meeting with a
    draft iteration plan.
</p>
<h3>
    Define high-level objectives
</h3>
<p>
    A key aspect of an iteration is to focus the team on a short-term deliverable of measurable value. Document between one
    and five high-level objectives to make sure that you do not lose focus on what to accomplish during the iteration.
    Typically, the project plan should outline one or several objectives for each iteration, and those objectives are used
    as a starting point. If you need to further detail or clarify the objectives as you plan your iteration, do so.
</p>
<p>
    The objectives are usually based on the following factors:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Critical risks not yet mitigated:</strong> Iteration goals often include driving down the most critical
        risks.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>The time allocated to the iteration:</strong> Iterations are fixed in duration, so the Project Manager must
        ensure that the goals for the iteration are realistic relative to the time and the resources allocated to the
        iteration.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>The highest priority features:</strong> Requirements are prioritized to ensure that the critical features
        of the application will be developed and tested early on.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Produce an Iteration Plan
</h3>
<p>
    There is an Iteration Plan per iteration that should outline who will implement which work item in how long a time.
    Since iterations are time-boxed, you need to understand how big your "box" is by assessing how many hours of actual
    work can be taken on (see <a class="elementLinkWithType"
    href="./../../../core.mgmt.common.extend_supp/guidances/guidelines/agile_estimation_A4EF42B3.html"
    guid="_CGHskBEdEdqY7JB6N6CW2w">Guideline: Agile Estimation</a>. Let's assume that you have six team members, and you
    have 15 working days in your iteration, and you on average can do five actual hours of work per person and day. This
    will give you 6x15x5h = 450 hours of actual work. Note that the average team member only performs between four and six
    hours of actual project work per day, with the rest being consumed by e-mails, meetings, and other overhead activities
    not directly related to the project.
</p>
<p>
    The team should then revisit and update priorities for all of the high-priority items in the Work Items List, to make
    sure that an important work item is not missed that would otherwise fall just below the list of what can be taken on in
    this iteration.
</p>
<p>
    Pick the top-priority work item and see if it matches the objectives of the iteration. If it does, assess whether the
    work item is too big to take on within an iteration. If it is too big, break it down into smaller work items. Once the
    work item has been decomposed, the team determines whether to take on one or several child work items.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Example:</b> The team would like to take on the work item called <i>Develop Use Case A</i>, but it would take
    roughly 300 hours to develop, so they feel that it is only necessary to do a subset of the use case to achieve their
    iteration objectives, allowing them to take on other high-priority work items. They divide the work item into five
    smaller work items representing different scenarios of use case A. The team decides to take on one out of the five
    identified scenarios in this iteration.
</p>
<p>
    When a team has decided to take on a work item, it will assign the work to one or several team members. Ideally, this
    is done by team members signing up to do the work, because this makes people motivated and committed to doing the job.
    However, based on your team culture, you may instead have the project manager assign the work.
</p>
<p>
    The next step is for team member(s) to assess how many actual hours or days it will take to do the work. Ideally, you
    want to have each work assignment to be from a few hours up to&nbsp;two days of work. If the work item is too big,
    consider breaking it down into smaller work items.
</p>
<p>
    The team sums up the actual estimate for each work item they have committed to, and checks if they can commit to any
    more work.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Example:</b> Jack signed up to develop the chosen scenario for use case A. He thinks that it would take 50 hours, so
    he decided to develop the work into a set of tasks, and he asks other team members to help out with various subtasks:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Detail the requirements (Jack): five hours
    </li>
    <li>
        Design the scenario (Jack, Ann, and David): five hours
    </li>
    <li>
        Implement and test the dB changes (Ann): 12 hours
    </li>
    <li>
        Implement and test the server portion (David): 16 hours
    </li>
    <li>
        Implement and test the client portion (Jack): 12 hours
    </li>
    <li>
        Total: 50 hours
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    As work items are decomposed into smaller tasks, estimates can typically be improved. You also better come to
    understand what is involved, and whether other team members may be better suited to take on a subset of the task.
</p>
<p>
    The team now determines whether they are willing to take on another work item by comparing actual hours signed up for
    to the actual hours available. In this case, the team has only signed up for 50 hours so far, and hence has another 400
    hours available.
</p>
<h3>
    Define Evaluation Criteria
</h3>
<p>
    It is critical that it is clear to all team members and other stakeholders how you will measure success at the end of
    the iteration. Obvious success criteria should include that you can test the functionality implemented, and that no or
    few defects are detected. Having too many defects makes it impossible to use the functionality, and it will prevent
    meaningful feedback. Test objectives and test cases need to be clearly outlined.
</p>
<p>
    There may be other success criteria, such as that you demo the capabilities to a certain set of stakeholders with
    favorable review comments, or that you can successfully demonstrate or make available a tech preview at a conference.

    Overview
</h3>
<p>
    The <a class="elementLinkWithType"
    href="./../../../core.mgmt.common.extend_supp/workproducts/work_items_list_39D03CC8.html"
    guid="_rGNWsCbSEdqh1LYUOGRh2A">Artifact: Work Items List</a>&nbsp;captures all scheduled work to be done within the
    project, as well as proposed work that may affect the product. Some of the work items may be implemented in this
    project, some of them may be implemented in a future project, and some of them may never be implemented.
</p>
<p>
    Some of the work items may still be poorly defined; therefore, it could represent a big chunk of work, requiring
    potentially several staff months of effort. As the priority of these work items increases, they are typically
    decomposed into smaller work items that represent specific and well-defined tasks that may take hours or days to
    address, see <a class="elementLink"
    href="./../../../practice.mgmt.iterative_dev.base/guidances/concepts/micro_increments_C8773066.html"
    guid="_S80VwCNbEdyCq8v2ZO4QcA">Micro-Increments</a>. In other cases, specific and well-defined work items are created
    directly, representing, for example, a defect to be addressed, as Figure 1illustrates.
</p>

</div>
<p>
    A work item may represent work associated with a defect, enhancement request, change request, use case, scenario, user
    story, supporting requirement, stakeholder request, or anything else that captures a potential requirement or
    improvement to your system. A work item may reference any type of requirement or other useful information that guides
    you in what needs to be done.
</p>
<p>
    A big advantage with the <a class="elementLinkWithType"
    href="./../../../core.mgmt.common.extend_supp/workproducts/work_items_list_39D03CC8.html"
    guid="_rGNWsCbSEdqh1LYUOGRh2A">Artifact: Work Items List</a>&nbsp;is that it enables you to prioritize only one list
    containing all of the things that may need to be addressed, whether the work item represents work related to a
    requirement, enhancement, or defect. The one exception is that you should prioritize the risk list separately.
</p>
<p>
    Nothing in the project will get done if it is not represented or mapped to a work item. This means that all
    requirements, defect reports, and change requests have to be mapped to a work item at some stage. Also, a developer
    will not take on work that is not represented in a work item. Only work items need to be prioritized. This also means
    that tracking work items is a primary means of understanding the status of the project.
</p>
<p>
    There are two major types of work items:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Unscheduled work items:</strong> These work items have not yet been assigned to an iteration, and there is
        no detailed effort estimate for the work item yet.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Scheduled work items:</strong> These work items are assigned to an iteration, and they typically have an
        additional set of attributes filled in, such as detailed effort estimates.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Unscheduled work items
</h3>
<p>
    Most work items are initially unscheduled, meaning that it has not yet been decided whether to do them and when to do
    them. Unscheduled work items should always represent something meaningful to deliver to stakeholders, such as a
    scenario to be detailed, designed, implemented, and tested. You may consider capturing the following data for such work
    items:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Name
    </li>
    <li>
        Description
    </li>
    <li>
        Priority
    </li>
    <li>
        Size estimate, such as a point estimate (see <a class="elementLinkWithType"
        href="./../../../core.mgmt.common.extend_supp/guidances/guidelines/agile_estimation_A4EF42B3.html"
        guid="_CGHskBEdEdqY7JB6N6CW2w">Guideline: Agile Estimation</a>)
    </li>
    <li>
        State, such as New, Assigned, Resolved, Verified, Closed (see work items states section below)
    </li>
    <li>
        Links to other reference material, such as requirements or detailed specifications of what needs to be done
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Scheduled work items
</h3>
<p>
    After a work item has been assigned to an iteration, it becomes <i>scheduled</i>. You assign work items only to the
    current or next iteration. There is no point in assigning work items to a specific future iteration, because you cannot
    predict what a meaningful schedule will be more than an iteration in advance (see <a class="elementLinkWithType"
    href="./../../../practice.mgmt.iterative_dev.base/guidances/guidelines/iteration_planning_C77F13CE.html"
    guid="_0auiMMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Guideline: Iteration Planning</a>).
</p>
<p>
    The following additional attributes are useful for Scheduled work items:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Target iteration
    </li>
    <li>
        Responsible team member
    </li>
    <li>
        Effort estimate left, such as actual hours of work (see <a class="elementLinkWithType"
        href="./../../../core.mgmt.common.extend_supp/guidances/guidelines/agile_estimation_A4EF42B3.html"
        guid="_CGHskBEdEdqY7JB6N6CW2w">Guideline: Agile Estimation</a>)
    </li>
    <li>
        Hours worked
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    This provides the information required to plan and manage an iteration. You can plan iterations by understanding effort
    involved, and you can manage iterations by tracking how much work is left to do (see <a class="elementLinkWithType"
    href="./../../../practice.mgmt.iterative_dev.base/guidances/reports/iteration_burndown_9C1C96F5.html"
    guid="_uAzgkDg3Edu4E8ZdmlYjtA">Report: Iteration Burndown</a>).
</p>
<h3>
    Work item states
</h3>
<p>
    The following states are useful for tracking work items:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>New:</b> The work item has been created, but not yet assigned to a team member.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Assigned:</b> A team member has been identified as responsible for the work item.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Resolved:</b> The team member responsible for the work items has implemented and tested the work item.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Verified:</b> The work item has been independently tested.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Closed:</b> The work item is no longer active.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    You may choose another set of states, based on your needs.

          <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h3>
    Getting started&nbsp;
</h3>
<p>
    Iterative development is based on the idea that a software system is built iteratively in a series of increments. Each
    increment adds a subset of the final system's functionality, and the system grows to become more and more complete over
    the course of the project's iterations.
</p>
<p>
    Consider making all of your iterations have the same duration. This is important for two reasons: it establishes the
    "heart beat" of the project, and it helps understand the project team's performance. This supports the creation of
    successively more accurate estimates of remaining work. Attack the hardest problems on the first iterations, but do not
    overload the first iteration too much. Make sure that you can show progress at the end of each iteration. Do not extend
    an iteration in order to finish work, but also do not finish an iteration without any software to be demonstrated. If
    needed, break the problem into smaller, more manageable pieces so that this balance can be achieved.
</p>
<p>
    Plan an iteration in detail only when it is due to start. Each iteration starts with an iteration planning meeting with
    the whole project team. In this meeting, the objectives of the iteration are defined in terms of work items, tasks are
    identified for these work items, and team members sign up for tasks and provide their estimates. At the end of the
    iteration planning meeting, the iteration plan is comprised of a set of work items, decomposed into tasks that
    individual team members sign up for. The iteration can be started. Once an iteration is under way, it should be allowed
    to proceed according to its plan, with as little external interruption as possible.
</p>
<p>
    During the course of the iteration, team members provide frequent status of their tasks in focused meetings. The
    frequency of these meetings is decided by team: it could be daily, a couple times a week, or weekly. Team members work
    on the tasks they signed up for, following the appropriate priority. Allow detailed informal peer coordination to
    happen, and mark completed work items in the iteration plan. The overall iteration status is hence readily available in
    the iteration plan at all times. Any work items that have not been justifiably completed by the end of the iteration
    are removed from the iteration and re-assigned to the next one (or just returned to the work items list).
</p>
<p>
    Make all iterations follow the same pattern. This helps the team to focus on activities that are specific to the
    beginning, middle, and end of an iteration. For example, some common activities performed during an iteration are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Iteration planning
    </li>
    <li>
        Iteration architecture work
    </li>
    <li>
        Continuous development of micro-increments
    </li>
    <li>
        Creation of stable weekly builds
    </li>
    <li>
        Bug fixing
    </li>
    <li>
        Iteration review and Retrospective
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>
    Common Pitfalls
</h3>
<p>
    There are common pitfalls experienced when adopting an iterative approach, including the ones listed in the following
    sections. Fore more information on challenges when transitioning from waterfall to an iterative development approach,
    see <a class="elementlinkwithusertext"
    href="./../../../core.mgmt.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.mgmt_D80619F3.html#KRU00"
    guid="_JlTPUM6aEdyuBO4ZIzcyig">[KRU00]</a>.
</p>
<h4>
    What project managers should plan for
</h4>
<p>
    One of the most difficult situations for project managers is to transition from a traditional development approach
    (such as waterfall) to an iterative approach. There is more planning with iterative development than with waterfall:
    one plan per iteration. At every iteration, there is negotiation with stakeholders, changes in scope, and re-planning.
    Project managers need to avoid detailed planning upfront, and should work with their best estimates for the tasks at
    hand in a given iteration.
</p>
<p>
    However, this behavior should not result in unplanned and non-prioritized requirements creating scope-creep, nor
    unnecessary rework happening on elements that are not broken. The iteration plan, with iteration objectives and planned
    tasks, should be collaboratively created by the project manager, the team, and stakeholders in order to promote a
    common understanding and buy-in into what is expected at the end of an iteration.
</p>
<h4>
    Which comes first: specifications or software?
</h4>
<p>
    In a waterfall approach, progress is often measured by the completion of specifications. For example, if the design
    specification is completed and signed-off, the team advances to the implementation based on the design specification.
</p>
<p>
    With iterative development, artifacts evolve throughout the iterations, and every iteration should result in an
    increment in the capabilities offered by the solution: in other words, implemented, tested software that is able to be
    demonstrated (and potentially shipped) to customers. Software comes first. Planning is more important than the plans.
    Designing and architecting an evolving solution is more important than capturing and polishing design and architecture
    models. At the end of each iteration, perform an assessment to gauge the completion of requirements that have passed
    test cases. Another way to make significant progress is by focusing on the harder problems (or risks) as early as
    possible, thus making sure that you create and use a sound, executable architecture as the basis for the other
    requirements.
</p>
<h4>
    Different iterations for the different disciplines
</h4>
<p>
    A common problem found in organizations moving from a waterfall to an iterative process is that they use the iteration
    concept only as an "envelope" for their engineering disciplines. For example, it is common to hear people in those
    organizations talk about "requirements iteration" or "test iteration". A fundamental tenet of iterative development is
    that it takes a holistic view of work items: each work item assigned to an iteration is completed in that iteration.
    For example, a "Login User" work item would see all required tasks (such as design, code, and test) to complete that
    work item. At the end of the iteration, the Login User behavior can be demonstrated as an integral part of the
    executable system.
</p>
<h4>
    No visible progress
</h4>
<p>
    Some teams will have work items that are not completed during an iteration as expected, and will not report problems.
    This creates a false impression that work items planned for the iteration are being closed, thus showing an inaccurate
    iteration burndown.<br />
    In order to avoid this, monitor active tasks closely, and address any slippage promptly. Use frequent, short status
    meetings to gauge progress and detect issues. Create a "no blame" environment where everyone feels empowered by the
    team and actively seeks advice and help from the team.
</p>
<h4>
    Adding work to an ongoing iteration
</h4>
<p>
    Management or stakeholders may impose more work to be added to an on-going iteration. While this is sometimes
    legitimate (for business reasons), there is a risk that this work just gets informally accepted by the team, without
    passing through the Work Items List, where it gets prioritized with the remaining work.<br />
    In order to minimize the impact of new work being added to an iteration, make sure to involve stakeholders in the
    planning process, so that they understand the impact a new work item brings to the current iteration. Be prepared to
    negotiate the removal of lower priority work from the iteration, in order to accommodate the new requested work.
    Another approach is to convince stakeholders that in a few weeks the iteration will end (with demonstrable progress),
    and that the new work item can be prioritized and assigned to the next iteration.

          <KeyConsiderations><![CDATA[<p>
    Work items assigned to an iteration do not necessarily have the same priority. When selecting work items from the Work
    Items List, the iteration plan may end up having work items with different priorities (for example, you assign the
    remaining high priority work items, plus a few mid-priority ones from the Work Items List). Once work items have been
    assigned to the iteration, the team ensures that they can complete all work, regardless of original work item
    priorities. Deciding what to develop first on an iteration will vary across projects and iterations.

          <MainDescription><![CDATA[<p>
    <strong>1. Defining scope</strong><br />
    <br />
    Ideally you should be able to match your project to an existing process and tool configuration that has already been
    applied successfully on similar projects.<br />
    Thus the scope of your tailoring will be none or relatively small.<br />
    <br />
    Process tailoring is different from process instantiation. Process tailoring is about roles and procedures, whereas
    process instantiation is about specific individuals and specific work products. Process instantiation is covered by
    project management practices, and typically includes:<br />
    a. Identifying which individuals perform which roles (may include identifying backup individuals)<br />
    b. Identifying which individuals do which approvals<br />
    c. Where each work product is stored.<br />
    d. Creating project plans with work items that reflect the process.<br />
    <br />
    The following are some typical examples of project-specific process tailoring:<br />
    a. Adding/removing work products and tasks<br />
    b. Changing milestones, and what work products will be made available at each milestone, and their state of
    completion<br />
    c. Tool and/or format used for each work product<br />
    d. Responsibilities for review and approval (a RACI table is often useful)<br />
    e. Detailed procedures for reporting progress, performing measurements, managing requirements, managing change
    requests, etc.<br />
    <br />
    Sometimes projects will combine process tailoring and process instantiation. For example, you can create a RACI table
    that includes both individuals and roles, and create a table that says not only which work products will be produced,
    but also where the specific instances will be stored.<br />
    This blending is fine, the only drawback is that such information has to be updated for each project, and can't be used
    unchanged.<br />
    <br />
    <strong>2. Deciding how the process will be documented</strong><br />
    <br />
    The rest of this guideline assumes you are starting with a published process documented using Rational Method
    Composer.<br />
    There are several options for tailoring such a process (listed here from simple to more specialized)<br />
    <br />
    1. Automated<br />
    Tools can automate aspects of the process so that they do not have to be separately documented.<br />
    For example, the process template in Rational Team Concert can be tailored to require approvals before a work product
    is closed. Rational Requisite Pro can require specific attributes to be stored for specific requirements types. And so
    on.<br />
    <br />
    2. Document-based<br />
    You can create one or more documents that describe how your project process varies from the published process.<br />
    The Development Case is such a document. Examples of information that may be captured in a development case are:<br />
    - differences in how roles are applied<br />
    - which artifacts are added or dropped<br />
    - what level of review formality to apply at each milestone.<br />
    Other typical process documents include:<br />
    <br />
    •Manual Styleguide<br />
    •Project-specific Templates<br />
    •Measurement Plan<br />
    •Problem Resolution Plan<br />
    •Product Acceptance Plan<br />
    •Quality Assurance Plan<br />
    •Risk Management Plan<br />
    •Requirements Management Plan<br />
    •Configuration Management Plan<br />
    <br />
    Word templates are provided for these documents. Note that these documents can also be implemented as a website or a
    Wiki.<br />
    <br />
    3. Wiki-based<br />
    You can post a process on an EPF Wiki server. You can then add comments and make changes specific to your project. You
    can also attach documents created using the "document-based" approach.<br />
    <br />
    4. RMC Configuration<br />
    You can use Rational Method Composer to change the configuration and republish it.<br />
    You can select and deselect individual practices, or use the tailoring perspective to add/remove individual
    elements.<br />
    <br />
    5. Method Authoring<br />
    If you do need to do substantial tailoring, then you can author your own practices and plug-ins using a method
    authoring tool, such as EPF Composer or Rational(R) Method Composer.<br />
    Guidelines for this are outside the scope of this practice (this is considered to generally be an enterprise-scope
    concern).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>3. Developing Project-specific Content</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Ideally there is relatively little process content unique to the project.&nbsp; However, project specific information
    needs to be captured, and your team may develop their own best practices over time.&nbsp; Depending on the scope, and
    how you've decided to capture process content, this may be a minor step performed by one person, or may require several
    tasks assigned to several individuals.<br />
    <br />
    <strong>4. Deciding which tools will be used to create and maintain work products<br />
    </strong>Ideally you should be able to match your project to a tool configuration that has already been applied
    successfully on similar projects, and just make minor tweaks specific to your project.<br />
    <br />
    If you do need to make tool-fit choices, please refer to Practice: Organizational Process Definition, which has
    guidance on how to select, acquire,&nbsp;and configure tools for specific process needs.<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>5. Deploying the process<br />
    </strong>If only minor changes to the process have been made, then a simple briefing with affected stakeholders is
    generally sufficient.<br />
    However, if significant changes have been made to the process, or if the team is unfamiliar with the process being
    adopted, then we recommend having a workshop to familiarize the team.<br />
    Having mentors on the team, or accessible to the team, that are familiar with new practices can also increase the
    success of adopting the practices.<br />
    If skills are an issue, then additional training may be required and should be scheduled.

          <MainDescription><![CDATA[<p>
    The Development Case is used to&nbsp;document the results of tailoring a process. It provides a mechanism for
    describing how a project has tailored a process for their specific project.
</p>
<p>
    In general, the development case typically refers to a standard process, often defined at an organization level, and
    then describes how that process has been tailored or specialized for the project.&nbsp; This typically includes:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Information about how the process varies from the standard process, and why (typically by identifying work products
        added or removed from the process)
    </li>
    <li>
        What work products are reviewed at which milestones, and their level of completion
    </li>
    <li>
        References to guidelines and information that the project wants to use in addition to the information contained in
        the main process.
    </li>
    <li>
        What reviews will be performed, and their level of formality.
    </li>
    <li>
        What approvals are required, by whom, and when.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The development case also includes information on what was tailored and why.

          <Application>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The best way to read this practice is to first familiarize yourself with its overall structure: what it is in it and&#xD;
    how it is organized.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The best place to start is with the &lt;strong>Key Concepts&lt;/strong> for the practice: those concepts that are critical to&#xD;
    understand in order to adopt the practice. Once you understand the key concepts, you can turn your attention to the&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Work Products&lt;/strong> produced by the practice. Then you can review the practices &lt;strong>Tasks&lt;/strong>. From&#xD;
    the work products and the tasks, you can access applicable guidance: guidelines and tool mentors associated with each&#xD;
    task provide details about how to perform the task. Templates and checklists associated with the work products guide&#xD;
    you in their completion and evaluation. You can also access the guidance provided by the practice directly, via the&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Guidance&lt;/strong> folder.&#xD;

          <Problem>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The purpose of this practice is to guide the project team on tailoring and deploying the process to be followed by the&#xD;
    team. The team also makes decisions such as how to use work products, what the project-specific guidelines are, and so&#xD;
    on. The tools to support the project are installed, configured, and used by the team.&#xD;

    depending on the size of the project and the project members' familiarity with similar development processes.&lt;br />&#xD;
    The following are commonly used ways to educate the project members:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Briefing&lt;br />&#xD;
        If the change is small or easy to understand a briefing to the team may be sufficient.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Mentors&lt;br />&#xD;
        Having experienced mentors or consultants on the project or available to the project is an effective way to provide&#xD;
        guidance on an as-needed basis.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Workshop&lt;br />&#xD;
        A one day process adoption workshop (PAW) for all project members can help &quot;kick-start&quot; a new or significantly&#xD;
        changed process. See Guidelines: Process Adoption Workshop&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Customized training courses.&lt;br />&#xD;
        If the project member have not attended the standard training courses in process and tools, an alternative is to&#xD;
        customize the standard training courses, to cover the project's development process, including guidelines,&#xD;
        templates and tools. However, it can be expensive to customize training courses. Generic process training, like an&#xD;
        introductory course to the Process or one or more practices, should be conducted prior to project startup, or in&#xD;
        the early days of the project. More specialized training in techniques, methods or technologies, is often conducted&#xD;
        &quot;just-in-time&quot;. This means that the training is given shortly before the method or technique is to be applied in&#xD;
        the project, to ensure that new knowledge is fresh in mind. &quot;Boot-camps&quot;.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        1-5 weeks of concentrated hands-on training. Not many organizations can afford to arrange these kinds of&#xD;
        boot-camps, but they have proven to be efficient if there are many new factors for the people in the project. A&#xD;
        boot-camp is typically a mixture of seminars, training courses and hands-on work with the process and tools.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

<p>
    This classification scheme can be extended or customized to reflect your organization's individual culture.
</p>
<p>
    An example of when this classification scheme may be adjusted depends on the level of tailoring that is being
    performed.&nbsp; For example, when tailoring a process for a specific project, the decision of whether or not a
    specific work product is to be used is made as part of the tailoring effort. In such cases, the above classification
    scheme may be reduced&nbsp;to "Required" and "Not Required".&nbsp; In other cases, say when you are tailoring a process
    for an organization and further tailoring for individual projects is expected, a more extensive classification scheme
    as described in the above table becomes important.
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="Impact" name="Impact">Impact</a> of Classification
</h3>
<p>
    All work products classified as <i>Must have</i> or <i>Should have</i> must have their review procedures, tools,
    templates and configuration management practices defined.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    The specification of these procedures is optional for work products classified as <i>Could have</i>-these decisions
    could be left to the developers or projects that decide to produce these work products.
</p>
<p>
    All work products classified as <i>Won't have</i> must have their omission justified.
</p>
<p>
    The major benefit of adopting this classification scheme is that it clearly denotes how the process has been
    customized, and where there are options for negotiation and local decision making.
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="Examples" name="Examples">Examples of Usage</a>
</h3>
<p>
    One way to think about the work product classification scheme is that it sets constraints on how the work products are
    used.
</p>
<p>
    For example, if you decide that the project could have an Analysis Model, then further customization could adjust these
    values by deciding that the project will meet one of the following criteria:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        It will have an Analysis Model
    </li>
    <li>
        It won't have an Analysis Model
    </li>
    <li>
        It will stay in its current state (an Analysis Model is optional)
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The classification scheme can even be used dynamically-allowing the status of the work product to change depending upon
    which phase the project is in.
</p>
<p>
    The following table shows different ways of treating the Analysis Model. The <b>How to use</b> column defines how the
    work product is used in each of the phases.

    used to create the work product, where the work product is kept or what tool is used to manage it. This can be
    accomplished by embedding a work product addendum to the development case, such as in spreadsheet format.

          <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h3 class="Section1">
    The XYZ Project Process
</h3>
<h3 class="Section1">
    1. Introduction
</h3>
<h4 class="Section1">
    1.1 Purpose
</h4>
<p class="MsoBodyText">
    This document describes the process followed by project XYZ.
</p>
<h4 class="Section1">
    1.2 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
</h4>
<p class="MsoBodyText">
    See the <u><font color="#0000ff">XYZ Project Glossary</font></u> (XYZ-GLO) for a comprehensive list of terms used on
    this project.
</p>
<h4 class="Section1">
    1.3 Overview
</h4>
<p class="MsoBodyText">
    Project XYZ generally follows the <u><font color="#0000ff">Disciplined Agile Delivery for ABC V2.0</font></u> (DAD-ABC)
    process configuration, which is the default software development process for most projects at Company ABC.
</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">
    The remainder of this development case addresses how this project deviates from the standard process. It explains how
    the lifecycle model, discipline workflows, work products usage, and associated roles are customized for the needs of
    XYZ Project.
</p>
<h3 class="Section1">
    2. Lifecycle
</h3>
<p class="Section1">
    The XYZ Project modifies the standard lifecycle described in DAD-ABC as follows:
</p>
<div class="Section1">
    <ul type="square">
        <li>
            Drop "Elaboration" phase and the "Lifecycle architecture" milestone, in order to follow a more evolutionary
            architecture approach. However, weekly project status reporting will report progress on architecture risks.
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
<p>
    Thus the phases and milestones will be as follows:
</p>
<ul type="square">
    <li>
        Inception phase
    </li>
    <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
        <ul type="circle">
            <li>
                stakeholder consensus achieved
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Construction phase:
    </li>
    <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
        <ul type="circle">
            <li>
                Sufficient functionality
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Transition phase
    </li>
    <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
        <ul type="circle">
            <li>
                Production ready
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    3. Practices
</h3>
<p class="MsoBodyText">
    Project XYZ follows all the practices in DAD-ABC, with the exception of "Staged Integration". The project is small
    enough that only a single integration stream is required, and no dedicated integrator role is required.
</p>
<h3>
    4. Work Products
</h3>
<p>
    With regards to work products, the XYZ project has some deviations from DAD-ABC as listed below:
</p>
<ul type="square">
    <li>
        Formal-Internal reviews and approvals are made by the Product Manager role, as opposed to the external Project
        Review Authority established by the <u><font color="#0000ff">ABC Governance Process</font></u> (ABC-GOV).
    </li>
    <li>
        Globalization Plan is waived: the XYZ product will be initially marketed in North America, and therefore a waiver
        for translation is requested.
    </li>
    <li>
        Software Architecture Document is not produced; instead, we generate automated reports from our visual modeling
        tool.
    </li>
    <li>
        Added new artifact for Storyboards, which are maintained in Rational Requirements Composer tool
    </li>
    <li>
        Rational Team Concert tool is used to capture User Stories description and related work. The User Stories in
        Rational Team Concert are linked to the respective Storyboards in Rational Requirements Composer.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    5. Reports
</h3>
<p class="MsoBodyText">
    In addition to standard metrics required by ABC-GOV, the Team Lead gathers Requirements Traceability Coverage metrics
    and use Rational Insight tool to generate them, as there is a need to be aware of high level system requirements that
    were allocated to and refined by the XYZ project team.
</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">
    The team lead takes snapshots of all metrics every 2 weeks as opposed to once a month, as indicated by ABC-GOV.
</p>
<h3>
    6. Roles
</h3>
<p class="MsoBodyText">
    Added Course Developer role to the team - as part of the project we need to produce training material.
</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">
    Team Lead on this project will be referred to as covering both the Project Manager and Architect roles.
</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">
    Note: The assignment of specific individuals to particular roles or job positions is documented in the <u><font
    color="#0000ff">XYZ Project Plan</font></u> (XYZ-PPLAN).

    Many software-development tools support teams of people, with several users working with information stored in a shared
    repository. Each user uses the tool on their personal computer (client) and the shared repository is stored on a
    central server.&nbsp;In this case the tool must be installed on the server and on the clients. Customizing the tool is
    done both on the server and on the client.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    There are tools that do not use a shared repository, such as compilers, debuggers, editors, graphic tools, etc. These
    tools can simply be installed on the users' computers. It may still be needed to customize the tools so that all
    members of the project use the tool in the same way.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    The approach should be to automate as much as possible of the installation and customization procedures.

    Identify what other software is required for the specific tool to work, and install this software.&amp;nbsp;For example, a&#xD;
    tool may require a database management system (DBMS) be installed first.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    When you have installed the support software, you can install the tool on the server.&#xD;

    Decide how to customize the tool so that it supports the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In addition to customizing the tools, you should set up user groups and access rights on the server.&amp;nbsp; In some&#xD;
    cases, a tool may provide its own mechanisms for this.&amp;nbsp; In other cases, user groups and access rights are defined&#xD;
    using the operating system.&amp;nbsp; The configuration of user groups and access rights affects how the tools can be used.&#xD;
    For example, you can set constraints on what parts of a repository certain users will have access to.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Document the customizations in project-specific guidelines.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    Integrate the tool with other tools to make it easier to use. An integration between tools is in most cases in the form&#xD;
    of an extension to one or several tools. An 'integration extension' to a tool typically:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Synchronize data between the different tools. It automates the creation and maintenance of related items in&#xD;
        development projects&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Automatically adds traceability between related items in different tools.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Allow the user to add traceability between items in different tools.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Allow the user to navigate between tools. For example, access an item in a test tool from a requirements management&#xD;
        tool.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Allow the user to run certain functionality from one tool. For example, the possibility to create items in another&#xD;
        tool.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Allow the user to version a tool's items in a configuration management tool.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Most tools offer ready-to-use extensions to integrate tools with each other.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Describe how the tools are integrated with each other in the project-specific guidelines.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;

            <Description>&lt;a id=&quot;Install Tools on Clients&quot; name=&quot;Install Tools on Clients&quot;>&lt;/a> &#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Install the tool on each client. The least that is needed to do when installing a tool on the client side, is to set up&#xD;
    the connection to the repository on the server.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Customize the tool on the clients, just as you customized the tool on the server:&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        In some cases you do not have to do anything with the client. For example, if the client is a web-interface it is&#xD;
        enough that the clients get the address to the application on the server. Some tools allow you to do all&#xD;
        customization on the server side. When the users access the repository on the server, they automatically get the&#xD;
        correct settings.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        In other cases you customize the tool on the client by installing software that customizes the tool, or installing&#xD;
        files with customization information.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It may be necessary to install 'integration software' on the client. Place the 'integration software' on a server and&#xD;
    allow the users to download and install it on their computers.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If it possible you should automate the tool installation, and the tool customization for the users. The benefit of&#xD;
    creating installation programs is that it allows you to set up the tools so that the clients get all the right&#xD;
    settings, extensions, and connections to the repository.&amp;nbsp; You create installation (and customization) programs,&#xD;
    and place them on a server. Then the users download these programs and run them to install and customize the tool in&#xD;
    their computer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br />&#xD;

          <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h3>
    Install the Tool on the Server
</h3>
<p>
    Identify what other software is required for the specific tool to work, and install this software. For example, a tool
    may require a database management system (DBMS) be installed first.<br />
    <br />
    When you have installed the support software, you can install the tool on the server.
</p>
<h3>
    Customize the Tool (on the Server)
</h3>
<p>
    Decide how to customize the tool so that it supports the Development Process in the best way.&nbsp; The following are
    some brief examples of how you can customize tools:
</p>
<h4>
    Modeling tools
</h4>
<p>
    You can create a template model that defines the structure of models. The template model will be used when creating a
    new model. You can create a file in which you define what stereotypes to use, and their icons. Then this file can be
    installed on all users' computers, so that they use the same set of stereotypes.
</p>
<h4>
    Requirements and Change Management tools
</h4>
<p>
    You can create a project template, in which you define the attribute types to use. You can start with provided
    templates and customize according to your needs.
</p>
<h4>
    Configuration Management tools
</h4>
<p>
    You can often configure actions in response to 'events' that make the tool behave in a certain way. For example, you
    can customize the tool so that when a user checks-in an item, a script is automatically executed that does some
    checking on the item.&nbsp; There may also be customizations that support distributed development, such as "multi-site"
    support with duplicated repositories.
</p>
<h3>
    Document the customizations in your process.<br />
    <br />
    Integrate with Other Tools
</h3>
<p>
    Integrate the tool with other tools to make it easier to use. An integration between tools is in most cases in the form
    of an extension to one or several tools. An 'integration extension' to a tool typically:
</p>
<p>
    Synchronize data between the different tools. It automates the creation and maintenance of related items in development
    projects<br />
    Automatically adds traceability between related items in different tools.<br />
    Allow the user to add traceability between items in different tools.<br />
    Allow the user to navigate between tools. For example, access an item in a test tool from a requirements management
    tool.<br />
    Allow the user to run certain functionality from one tool. For example, the possibility to create items in another
    tool.<br />
    Allow the user to version a tool's items in a configuration management tool. For example, the possibility to version
    control requirements (from RequisitePro) using ClearCase.<br />
    Most tools offer ready-to-use extensions to integrate tools with each other.
</p>
<p>
    Describe how the tools are integrated with each other in the process.
</p>
<h3>
    Install and Customize Tools on Clients
</h3>
<p>
    Install the tool on each client. The least that is needed to do when installing a tool on the client side, is to set up
    the connection to the repository on the server.<br />
    <br />
    Customize the tool on the clients, just as you customized the tool on the server:<br />
    <br />
    In some cases you do not have to do anything with the client. For example, if the client is a web-interface it is
    enough that the clients get the address to the application on the server. Some tools allow you to do all customization
    on the server side. When the users access the repository on the server, they automatically get the correct
    settings.<br />
    In other cases you customize the tool on the client by installing software that customizes the tool, or installing
    files with customization information.<br />
    It may be necessary to install 'integration software' on the client. Place the 'integration software' on a server and
    allow the users to download and install it on their computers.<br />
    <br />
    If it possible you should automate the tool installation, and the tool customization for the users. The benefit of
    creating installation programs is that it allows you to set up the tools so that the clients get all the right
    settings, extensions, and connections to the repository. You create installation (and customization) programs, and
    place them on a server. Then the users download these programs and run them to install and customize the tool in their
    computer.
</p>
<h3>
    Setting up workspaces
</h3>
<p>
    Most project teams require workspaces for a variety of purposes including:
</p>
<p>
    - development workspaces for individuals to do their work
</p>
<p>
    - integration workspaces for individuals to share their work
</p>
<p>
    - build workspaces for builds that have achieved a certain level of quality
</p>
<p>
    Part of setting up the tool environment is to set up the needed workspaces and the policies for how they are used.

    The following are typical activities and key considerations when tailoring the Configuration Management process area.
</p>
<p>
    Describe conventions for naming and versioning project and product work products (corporate conventions you may need to
    comply with).
</p>
<p>
    Adopt a standard product directory structure for putting&nbsp;artifacts under version control. Add components specific
    to your project. (Ideally a standard structure is available as as an enterprise asset or example.)
</p>
<p>
    Analyze issues involved in setting up the CM environment,&nbsp;such as:<br />
    •&nbsp;anticipated size of product data<br />
    •&nbsp;distribution of the product team<br />
    •&nbsp;physical location of servers and client machines
</p>
<p>
    You should adopt a standard template for your project's CM system that establishes appropriate streams, roles and
    responsibilities. (Ideally a standard template is available as as an enterprise asset or example.)&nbsp; The template
    for your CM system should include an approach for managing change requests, including enhancements and defects
    generated by the team and external stakeholders.
</p>
<p>
    Be aware and comply with policies for project media storage and release.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Document&nbsp;how software developed by vendors and subcontractors&nbsp;is incorporated into version control.

    For a given process area, you may need to refine or adapt the organizational process to accommodate your project needs.
    The following are typical activities and key considerations when tailoring the Risk Management process area for your
    project:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Refine&nbsp;the approach to be used to identify risks, and how risks will be analyzed and prioritized.
    </li>
    <li>
        Refine&nbsp;the list of&nbsp;potential sources of risk, as well as typical risk categories, and impacted
        stakeholders, which will help the team identify risks for the project.

        strategies that will be used in your project, including mitigation, avoidance, and/or prevention strategies for the
        most significant ("Top 10") risks.</span></span></span>
    </li>
    <li>
        Refine how the status of each significant risk and its mitigation activities will be monitored. Refine the
        acceptability thresholds against which risks will be periodically compared in order to determine the need for
        implementing a risk mitigation plan. Refine how risk review and reporting schedules will happen, and what frequency
        of reviews your project requires.
    </li>
    <li>
        List specific groups or individuals involved in the project's risk management activities for your project, and
        provide a description of the tasks and responsibilities of each.
    </li>
    <li>
        Specify the budget available in your project for managing project risks (when this information is not already
        included in the overall project budget).
    </li>
    <li>
        List&nbsp;tools and techniques that will be used in your project to store risk information, evaluate risks, track
        the status of risks or generate risk management reports.
    </li>
    <li>
        List&nbsp;the risk items that have been identified in your project. Decide if this&nbsp;will be&nbsp;a link to a
        separate Risk List artifact for the project or not. Publish and keep visible a "Top 10" list of risks that are
        considered significant enough for the project to spend resources on their management.<br />

    The project burndown report is&nbsp;the primary tool for understanding the status of a project. It shows the trend for
    how much work is left to do within that project. This is done by adding the estimated effort left for each of the work
    items to be addressed within the project, and showing how the estimated effort is changing from iteration to iteration.
    The project burndown report should be updated at the end of each iteration.
</p>
<p>
    The project burndown rate is usually communicated in graphical form.&nbsp;The project burndown chart consists of two
    perspectives, with the horizontal axis showing the iterations and the vertical axis indicating the remaining points
    from the work items list. Additionally, the average burndown rate from previous iterations is calculated, and a trend
    for the remainder of the project forecasted from that historical data.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Project burndown management is an enabling technique that allows direct linkage of iteration goals to work items. The
    project manager will use the project burndown information for communicating progress and trends to senior management.

    be done in the given time-frame. Out-of-scope work can be considered&amp;nbsp;for future releases.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The team should not spend too much time&amp;nbsp;doing this planning. The project plan should document only&amp;nbsp;a brief&#xD;
    summary of&amp;nbsp;project milestones&amp;nbsp;and between one and three objectives for each iteration. Do not commit&#xD;
    individual work items to the plan, because this will force too much re-planning. The goal is just to create a&#xD;
    high-level plan outlining how&amp;nbsp;the team&amp;nbsp;can build the resulting application in the given set of iterations.&#xD;
    Extra levels of detail will be achieved in other planning sessions throughout the project (for example, when planning&#xD;
    iterations). You may need to revisit&amp;nbsp;this plan&amp;nbsp;later to adapt it based on what you will&#xD;

          <MainDescription><![CDATA[<p>
    Good software development teams are made up of a collection of people who collaborate effectively. How the project team
    is staffed, by either adding or removing people, will greatly impact the team's productivity.
</p>
<p>
    When staffing a development project, consider the following advice:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Include people who fit into the existing team culture. Good teams do not just appear magically one day, but instead
        are grown and nurtured over time. Invite people onto the team who will add value and, furthermore, who will not be
        disruptive. Similarly, you may need to invite someone to leave the team if they do not fit well with the existing
        team and they do not seem to be able to change.
    </li>
    <li>
        People should want to be on the team. People are far more productive when they are working on a project that they
        believe in and want to see succeed.
    </li>
    <li>
        Build your team with "generalizing specialists". A generalizing specialist is someone with one or more technical
        specialties who actively seeks to gain new skills in their existing specialties as well as in other areas,
        including both technical and domain areas. Generalizing specialists add value to the team because they have
        specialized skills that you need, while at the same time appreciate the full range of issues that a general
        understanding of the software development process and the business domain offers.
    </li>
    <li>
        Include stakeholders. stakeholders, including business stakeholders (such as end users) and technical stakeholders
        (such as operations staff), can add significant value to your team. Instead of just interviewing them to gain
        information from them, or asking them to review your work, why not include them as active participants on the team?
    </li>
    <li>
        Include specialists for short-term, specialized work. Specialists can still add value on an agile development team,
        particularly when they have specific skills and experience that existing team members do not have. It can often be
        very effective to bring a specialist into the team for a short period of time to help with a specific task (such as

        in a review).
    </li>
    <li>
        Assess available knowledge and skills. Give people opportunities to evolve their skills. At the beginning of a
        project, the team may not have the full range of skills that it needs, or perhaps a few individuals may not have
        the skills required to fulfill the roles they are filling. This is a very common risk taken by the majority of
        project teams for the simple reasons that you often cannot find the perfect combination of people and, even if you
        could, you still want to provide people with opportunities to grow as professionals. Determine skills improvement
        objectives and set up a plan to achieve them. Perform an assessment at major project milestones to track progress
        against objectives.

    <li>
        Remember Brook's Law. Adding people to a late project will only make it later [<a
        href="./../../../core.mgmt.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.mgmt_D80619F3.html#BRO95"
        guid="_JlTPUM6aEdyuBO4ZIzcyig">BRO95</a>]. The corollary is that removing people from a late project may speed
        things up [<a href="./../../../core.tech.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.tech_6CCF393.html"
        guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">AMB04</a>].
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Sometimes you will need to go against some of this advice due to environmental constraints. Perhaps only specialists
    are available (although there is nothing stopping a specialist from becoming a generalizing specialist), perhaps there
    are not as many opportunities for people to try new things as they would like, or perhaps the stakeholders are not
    available to be active members of the team. The advice above is designed to lead to as high-performing a team as
    possible, but even partial adherence to this guideline will improve the team.

          <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h3>
    Getting started&nbsp;
</h3>
<p>
    Release&nbsp;planning is concerned with creating a strategic project plan (where the internal and external releases of
    the project are identified), and tactical iteration plans for individual iterations within releases. It aims at
    creating the right level of granularity for each purpose, so that the investment in planning is held to a minimum.
</p>
<p>
    Begin by understanding the high-level features that the system is expected to possess. These are the system's main
    themes or services, and they are typically described or listed in a vision document. They serve to set goals and
    expectations, both internally and externally, and they guide and constrain the iteration planning.
</p>
<p>
    The project plan is coarser-grained than iteration plans. As <a class="elementLinkWithUserText"
    href="./../../../core.mgmt.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.mgmt_D80619F3.html#LEF07"
    guid="_JlTPUM6aEdyuBO4ZIzcyig">[LEF07]</a> notes, a system can be described with a list of 25-50 features, calibrated
    to the relative complexity of that system. Iteration plans, on the other hand, are described in terms of individual
    user stories, use cases and scenarios, or other work items that will be&nbsp;developed in each iteration.
</p>
<p>
    As early in the project as possible, ideally as part of the kick-off of a new project, hold a planning session (with
    the whole team and the stakeholders of the system) during which the initial project plan is established.
</p>
<p>
    Update the project plan as often as necessary to reflect changing business priorities and needs.
</p>
<p>
    Iteration plans help to estimate and track individual iterations. For each iteration, its plan is created just-in-time,
    based on the currently highest prioritized work items in the product backlog.
</p>
<h3>
    Common pitfalls
</h3>
<p>
    One of the biggest challenges with agile planning is to resist pressure from upper management if they require to see
    complete plans up-front in the project. This is best avoided by involving them in the planning process, and by
    demonstrating the value of empirical planning by making the process transparent and open (to the organization and the
    project's stakeholders) so that they can easily follow the progress of the project.
</p>
<p>
    It can be difficult to find the right level of granularity for the features of a given system. With too many features,
    the planning process becomes tedious and error-prone, and will work counter to the intent.

&lt;/p></Application>
          <Background>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Project planning is very inaccurate when you attempt to plan beyond the initial phases of work for any&#xD;
    project.&amp;nbsp;The Release Planning practice ensures that your planning efforts are iterative in nature, aligned with&#xD;
    the software delivery to ensure a more accurate estimate of work efforts.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In many cases, the planning horizon for a software project is a hard concept to understand. Software development&#xD;
    project managers tend to want to plan the entire project, and then let the team work the plan, resisting changes to the&#xD;
    plan as it executes. The Release Planning practice emphasizes the need to plan the next iteration in detail, while&#xD;
    planning the whole project at a high level. This practice also encourages the project manager to feel comfortable with&#xD;
    re-planning as needed to ensure accuracy in delivery dates and costs based on events that impact the project.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p></Background>
          <Goals></Goals>
          <LevelsOfAdoption></LevelsOfAdoption>
          <Problem>&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Why adopt this practice?&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Release&amp;nbsp;Planning improves the accuracy of project planning, the ability to predict resource usage, and the ability&#xD;
    to meet established delivery dates. In adopting this practice, the project team can better manage scarce resources and&#xD;
    focus on delivering scope with higher quality and value to the organization.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In some development approaches, project managers would plan the whole project at project initiation, and then execute&#xD;
    the plan, with little or no modifications to the original project plan unless there were significant scope changes or&#xD;
    risks that derailed the project. These approaches depend a lot on the project managers' personal knowledge of the&#xD;
    scope, and the resources available to deliver the scope. In many cases, these plans would become inaccurate and useless&#xD;
    after the first one or two phases. At that point, many project managers would simply manage the milestones and abandon&#xD;
    the detailed tasks.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Even seasoned project managers can benefit from Release Planning. As more and more software developers move to&#xD;
    iterative methods for delivering software, the need to perform just-in-time project planning is critical.&#xD;
    Planning&amp;nbsp;for the next few weeks is always more accurate than planning&amp;nbsp;for the next few months. The goal of&#xD;
    this practice is to balance the high-level and low-level planning such that detailed (low-level) planning occurs&#xD;
    just-in-time to support the successful delivery of the software products.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p></Problem>

    1 Introduction
</h3>
<p>
    This plan covers the content and enablement portions of the EPF 1.0 project. A separate plan covers the tooling
    component.
</p>
<h3>
    2 Project Organization
</h3>
<p>
    See also: <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/epf/">http://www.eclipse.org/epf/</a><br />
    <br />
    The work is divided into a number of content areas. Each content area is lead by a committer that is the content lead,
    working closely with a number of committers and contributors. The content lead is responsible for making sure that bugs
    and enhancement requests are triaged and assigned, and responsible for updating the project burndown (status) on a
    weekly basis.<br />
    <br />
    We also have a content architect (Ricardo Balduino), who is responsible for the overall structure and integration of
    content from all content areas.
</p>
<p>
    The work is divided into the following content areas:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Project management: Chris Armstrong (lead), Jochen Krebs, Per Kroll
    </li>
    <li>
        Requirements: Chris Sibbald (lead), Paul Bramble, Ana Paula Valente Pereira, Leonardo Medeiros, Kurt Sand, Bruce
        MacIsaac, Jim Ruehlin, Ricardo Balduino, and others.

    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    3 Project Practices and Measurements
</h3>
<p>
    The OpenUP component team will use OpenUP practices adapted to address the fact that we are doing content development
    rather than coding. Key artifacts include: Project Plan (Word), Work Item List (Bugzilla + Excel), Iteration Plan
    (Word), and Status Assessment (Word).
</p>
<p>
    Progress is tracked using two primary measurements using a point system. It is estimated that 1 point represents 2h of
    work:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Project backlog: The project backlog shows progress relative to overall work to be done within the project.
    </li>
    <li>
        Iteration backlog: The iteration backlog shows progress relative to work intended for the current iteration.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    4&nbsp; Project Milestones and Objectives
</h3>
<p>
    This section covers objectives for the entire EPF 1.0 project.

    The purpose in this phase is to complete the development of the system based upon the baselined architecture.
</p>
<p>
    There are objectives for the Construction phase that help us to&nbsp;have cost-efficient development of a complete
    product -- an operational version of your system -- that can be deployed&nbsp;in the user community&nbsp;<a

</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Iteratively develop a complete product that is ready to transition to its user community. Describe remaining
        requirements, fill in design details, complete the implementation, and test the software. Release the first
        operational version (beta) of the system and determine whether users are ready for the application to be deployed.
    </li>
    <li>
        Minimize development costs and achieve some degree of parallelism. Optimize resources and leverage development
        parallelism between developers or teams of developers by, for example, assigning components that can be developed
        independently of one another.
    </li>
</ol>
<h4>
    Key considerations
</h4>
<p>
    Typically, the Construction phase has more iterations (two to four) than the other phases, depending on the types of
    projects:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Simple project:</b> One iteration to build the product (to a beta release)
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>More substantial project:</b> One iteration to expose a partial system and one to mature it to beta testing
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Large project:</b> Three or more iterations, depending upon the size of the project (number of requirements to
        implement for a beta release)
    </li>
</ul>]]></MainDescription>

    The purpose of this phase is to establish the baseline of the architecture of the system and provide a stable basis for
    the bulk of the&nbsp;development effort in the next phase.
</p>
<p>
    There are objectives for the Elaboration phase that help you address risks associated with requirements, architecture,
    costs, and schedule <a class="elementlinkwithusertext"
    href="./../../../core.mgmt.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.mgmt_D80619F3.html#KRO03"
    guid="_JlTPUM6aEdyuBO4ZIzcyig">[KRO03]</a>:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Get a more detailed understanding of the requirements.</strong> Having a good understanding of the
            majority of requirements enables you to create a more detailed plan and to get buy-in from stakeholders. Be
            sure to gain an in-depth understanding of the most critical requirements to be validated by&nbsp;the
            architecture.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Design, implement, validate, and establish the baseline for the architecture.</strong> Design,
            implement, and test a skeleton structure of the system. Although the functionality is not complete yet, most of
            the interfaces between the building blocks are implemented and tested. This is referred to <i>an</i>
            <i>executable architecture</i>.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Mitigate essential risks, and produce accurate schedule and cost estimates.</strong> Many technical
            risks are addressed as a result of detailing the requirements and of designing, implementing, and testing the
            architecture. Refine and detail the high-level project plan.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Key considerations
</h4>
<p>
    The number of iterations in the Elaboration phase is dependent on, but not limited to, factors such as green-field
    development compared to maintenance cycle, unprecedented system compared to well-known technology and architecture, and
    so on.
</p>
<p>
    Typically, on the first iteration, it is better to design, implement, and test a small number of critical scenarios to
    identify what type of architecture and architectural mechanisms you need, so you can mitigate the most crucial risks.
    You also detail high-risk requirements that have to be addressed early in the project. You test enough to validate that
    the architectural risks are mitigated.

    During the subsequent iterations, you fix whatever was not right from the previous iteration. You design, implement,
    and test the remaining architecturally significant scenarios, ensuring that you check all major areas of the system
    (architectural coverage), so that potential risks are identified as early as possible. <a

<p>
    There are four objectives of the Inception phase that clarify the scope, project objectives, and feasibility of the
    intended solution <a class="elementlinkwithusertext"

        <p>
            <strong>Determine at least one possible solution.</strong> Assess whether the vision is technically
            feasible.&nbsp;This may involve identifying a candidate high-level architecture or doing technical prototypes,
            or both.

<h4>
    Key considerations
</h4>
<p>
    Projects may have one or more iterations in the Inception phase. These are among the reasons for multiple iterations:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Project is large, and it is hard to define its scope
    </li>
    <li>
        Unprecedented system
    </li>
    <li>
        Too many stakeholders with competing needs and complex relationships
    </li>
    <li>
        Major technical risks demand the creation of a prototype or proof of concept
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    There are some commonly observed&nbsp;counterproductive patterns during the Inception phase. Some teams postpone
    providing estimates until they analyze the entire domain and have written a large amount of requirements documentation.
    This behavior often leads to "analysis paralysis." Another pattern is poor planning of Inception iterations. Avoid such
    patterns by planning iterations during Inception in a way that iterations are risk-driven, include early integration
    and testing, and produce a product increment that you can demonstrate to stakeholders. By default, have one
    (potentially short) iteration in Inception to avoid analysis paralysis.

    From a&nbsp;development perspective, each iteration provides an increment of functionality to the product. Thus, the
    end of each iteration corresponds to a checkpoint where the project team demonstrates to stakeholders that the
    objectives for that iteration have been met.
</p>
<p>
    From a management perspective, the software lifecycle&nbsp;is decomposed over time into four sequential phases, each
    concluded by a major milestone [<a class="elementLinkWithUserText"
    href="./../../../core.mgmt.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.mgmt_D80619F3.html#BOE95"
    guid="_JlTPUM6aEdyuBO4ZIzcyig">BOE95</a>]. There are four major milestones that provide evaluation criteria at the end
    of each phase:

    width="406" border="0" />
</p>
<p>
    Each phase is&nbsp;a span of time between two major milestones and has specific focus and objectives. At the end of
    each phase, an assessment is performed to determine whether the objectives of the phase have been met. A satisfactory
    assessment allows the project to move to the next phase. When a milestone is not met, more iterations in the current
    phase may be performed before the milestone can be considered complete. Achieving a milestone represents an objective
    criteria with which to measure progress.

<p>
    The Transition phase can include running old and new systems in parallel, migrating data, training users, and adjusting
    business processes.
</p>
<p>
    The number of iterations in the Transition phase varies from one iteration for a simple system requiring primarily
    minor bug fixing, to many iterations for a complex system, involving addition of features and performing activities to
    make the business transition from using the old system to using the new system.
</p>
<p>
    When the Transition phase objectives are met, the project can be closed.&nbsp;For some products, the end of the current
    project lifecycle may coincide with the beginning of the next lifecycle, leading to the next generation of the same
    product.

    Overview
</h3>
<p>
    Although the entire purpose of a project is to produce a product, the specific goals of the team will vary
    substantially throughout the project. In the beginning, there usually is considerable latitude in the requirements for
    the product. It may not be clear whether the project is feasible or even if it is likely to be profitable. At that
    time, it is critical to bring an answer to these questions and of little to no value to start developing the product in
    earnest.&nbsp;Toward the end of the project, the product itself is usually complete, and issues of quality, delivery,
    and completeness then take center stage. At different points in time, tasks are undertaken in new ways and work
    products will have new content.
</p>
<p>
    To coordinate the team's efforts in a manner that takes these fundamental observations into account, the project
    lifecycle should be divided into a sequence of phases. Each phase has a defined set of goals, a particular iteration
    style, and customized&nbsp; <a class="elementLinkWithUserText"
    href="./../../../core.default.uma_concept.base/guidances/termdefinitions/task_6C1FF051.html"
    guid="_x459ktnmEdmO6L4XMImrsA">tasks</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a class="elementLinkWithUserText"
    href="./../../../core.default.uma_concept.base/guidances/termdefinitions/work_product_826E4C22.html"
    guid="_H4JXwB_SEdq6CKKKq4D7YA">work products</a> to address the unique needs of the project at that point. The project
    lifecycle provides <em>stakeholders</em> with oversight, transparency, and steering mechanisms to control project
    funding, scope, risk exposure, value provided, and other aspects of the process.
</p>
<p>
    It helps to organize iterations into phases. Each phase ends with a milestone aimed at providing oversight by raising
    and answering a set of questions that are typically critical to stakeholders:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <a class="elementLinkWithUserText"
        href="./../../../practice.mgmt.risk_value_lifecycle.base/guidances/concepts/inception_phase_C4456871.html"
        guid="_0hmKgBOMEduCNqgZdt_OaA">Inception</a>. Do we agree on project scope and objectives and whether or not the
        project should proceed?
    </li>
    <li>
        <a class="elementLinkWithUserText"
        href="./../../../practice.mgmt.risk_value_lifecycle.base/guidances/concepts/elaboration_phase_BE880435.html"
        guid="_2plxwBOMEduCNqgZdt_OaA">Elaboration</a>. Do we agree on the executable architecture to be used for
        developing the application, and do we find that the value delivered so far and the remaining risk is acceptable?
    </li>
    <li>
        <a class="elementLinkWithUserText"
        href="./../../../practice.mgmt.risk_value_lifecycle.base/guidances/concepts/construction_phase_873B6559.html"
        guid="_48EKsBOMEduCNqgZdt_OaA">Construction</a>. Do we find that we have an application that is sufficiently close
        to being released that we should switch the primary focus of the team to tuning, polishing, and ensuring successful
        deployment?
    </li>
    <li>
        <a class="elementLinkWithUserText"
        href="./../../../practice.mgmt.risk_value_lifecycle.base/guidances/concepts/transition_phase_DD5986E5.html"
        guid="__ca5UBOMEduCNqgZdt_OaA">Transition</a>. Is the application ready to release?
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    If the answer is Yes to those questions at the phase review, the project continues. If the answer is No, the phase is
    delayed (usually by adding an extra iteration) until a satisfactory answer is received, or the stakeholders may
    determine that the project should be canceled.
</p>
<p>
    Within each phase, you might have one or several iterations, where the iterations aim at producing the results required
    to answer these questions. As an example, to answer the question for Elaboration, we typically need to implement and
    test key aspects of the system so that we understand what architecture we need, what commercial, off-the-shelf (COTS)
    components we may need, what key risks we face and how to address them, the effectiveness of the team, and so on. These
    needs will steer how we prioritize what is to be done in an Elaboration iteration.
</p>
<p>
    One of the objectives of the project lifecycle is to focus on two key stakeholder drivers: <b>risk reduction</b> and
    <b>value creation</b>. As figure 1 shows, the&nbsp;four phases here described focus the team on risk reduction related
    to the questions to be answered at the end of the phase, while tracking value creation.
</p>
<p>
    <img height="268" alt="Risk goes down and value goes up as project progresses." src="practice.mgmt.risk_value_lifecycle.base/guidances/concepts/resources/project_lifecycle.jpg"
    width="500" />&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Figure 1 - Risk reduction (red curve) and value creation (green curve) during the project lifecycle</strong>
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    <i>Risk</i> is a manifestation of the likelihood of unexpected things happening to the project, and risk stands in the
    way of value creation. Risk is directly proportional to uncertainty in estimates, and stakeholders typically want to
    know sooner rather than later what value the project can deliver in the stipulated time. In many cases, you reduce risk
    when you create value by implementing and testing the most critical capabilities. However, there are situations where
    risk reduction and immediate value creation are at odds with each other, requiring careful balancing of these competing
    priorities to maximize stakeholder value.

          <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h3>
    Getting started&nbsp;
</h3>Organize your project into a set of phases, each providing a milestone where business and management decisions can be
made on whether the project should go to the next phase or not. A risk-value lifecycle&nbsp;provide stakeholders with
visibility on two main drivers: risks need to be driven down and value&nbsp;needs&nbsp;to be&nbsp;driven up.&nbsp;At the
end of each phase in the lifecycle, there is a milestone that will help answer the questions and find the balance between
risks and value. See <a class="elementLink"
href="./../../../practice.mgmt.risk_value_lifecycle.base/guidances/concepts/phase_milestones_5678231E.html"
guid="_HNxbwMBJEdqSgKaj2SZBmg">Phase Milestones</a>&nbsp;for more information on milestones and <a class="elementLink"
href="./../../../practice.mgmt.risk_value_lifecycle.base/guidances/concepts/project_lifecycle_203F87.html"
guid="_nSfVwCNYEdyCq8v2ZO4QcA">Project Lifecycle</a>&nbsp;for more information on balancing risks and value.<br />
<p>
    Divide phases into iterations that deliver an increment of software that you can&nbsp;demonstrate and, potentially,
    deliver.&nbsp;Each iteration in a phase will contain just enough of any activity required to meet the objectives of
    that phase by the time you meet the milestone that concludes it. If the milestone can't be satisfied, consider adding
    one more iteration to that phase until the expected risks&nbsp;for the phase are mitigated or the expected stakeholder
    value is provided.
</p>
<p>
    Plan the number of iterations in each phase according to the lifecycle pattern that is most appropriate to your
    project. For example, when the problem domain is familiar, the risks are well-understood, and the project team is
    experienced, you may need only one iteration in Inception and one in Elaboration phases, then&nbsp;you can have
    multiple iterations in Construction&nbsp;(to develop the requirements and architecture) and a few iterations in
    Transition to migrate the product to users.&nbsp;Another example is when the problem domain is new or unfamiliar or the
    team is inexperienced. In such a case, you might need several iterations in Elaboration to refine requirements and
    architecture as you implement them, then one iteration in&nbsp;Construction to deal with less critical requirements.
    For more information on lifecycle patterns see&nbsp;[<a class="elementLinkWithUserText"

    Phases are not identical in terms of schedule and effort. For example,&nbsp;a typical distribution&nbsp;of resources
    and time spent for a medium-sized project is represented in the table below.

<h3>
    Common pitfalls
</h3>
<p>
    A common misconception about the four unified process phases is to compare them to&nbsp;a waterfall approach, where one
    would expect to document all of the requirements in Inception, create the whole design and architecture in Elaboration,
    do all of the implementation in Construction, and test in Transition. Phases are&nbsp;time-allocated in the project
    schedule and&nbsp;provide a framework and milestones for making business and management decisions. Each iteration in
    each phase provides a complete pass through activities in the disciplines&nbsp;of software development (for example,
    requirements, design, implementation, integration, testing, and so on) and produces an executable&nbsp;increment of
    software&nbsp;that minimizes risks and grows in value.

          <Application>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The best way to read this practice is to first familiarize yourself with its overall structure: what it is in it and&#xD;
    how it is organized.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Start with understanding what phases are and how they relate to iterations.&amp;nbsp;Understand what phase milestones mean&#xD;
    and the questions that they help answer. See &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;

    guid=&quot;__ca5UBOMEduCNqgZdt_OaA&quot;>Transition Phase&lt;/a>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Then, understand the importance&amp;nbsp;of a structured lifecycle&amp;nbsp;in driving two&#xD;
    main&amp;nbsp;stakeholders'&amp;nbsp;concerns: risk reduction and value creation. See&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;

    Why adopt this practice?&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Project stakeholders look for&amp;nbsp;ways to understand and control project funding, scope, risk exposure, value&#xD;
    provided, and other aspects of the project. While&amp;nbsp;project iterations deliver&amp;nbsp;product increments that show&#xD;
    value delivered and show progress at a fine-grained level (meaning that work items are being addressed), they do not&#xD;
    provide the necessary project oversight, transparency, and steering mechanisms at a coarse-grained level that allow&#xD;
    stakeholders to make informed business decisions about the project.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The organization of iterations into a set of&amp;nbsp;phases -- with a well-defined milestone at the end of each phase --&#xD;
    provides the&amp;nbsp;structure that stakeholders and managers need to assess whether the objectives of the phase have been&#xD;
    met and&amp;nbsp;whether the project should move on to the next phase or not. See &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../practice.mgmt.risk_value_lifecycle.base/guidances/concepts/phase_milestones_5678231E.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_HNxbwMBJEdqSgKaj2SZBmg&quot;>Phase Milestones&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;for more&amp;nbsp;details.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    By addressing the goals and risks of each phase, the team has the opportunity to find the right balance between risk&#xD;
    reduction and immediate value creation, which are two major drivers for stakeholders. See &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;

    Each phase contains one or more iterations.&nbsp;After the last iteration of a phase is performed, there is a milestone
    that provides the questions that check whether the objectives of that phase were met or not, thereby giving
    stakeholders and management the opportunity to make business decisions about whether the project should continue to the
    next phase or not.

          <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h3>
    Getting started&nbsp;
</h3>
<p>
    Implementing an effective change management process requires agreement on the appropriate level of change control. Not
    all projects require the same level of control.
</p>
<p>
    For small, co-located teams, a relatively light-weight process such as the one described here is sufficient.
</p>
<p>
    For larger teams, or teams working on safety- or business-critical applications where the cost of failure is very high,
    there is a need for more formal change control.
</p>
<p>
    This practice describes the simplest possible change management approach, one in which change management is an integral
    part of project management. In this approach, any one may request a change to the system (or supporting artifacts) at
    any time, either to correct an identified defect or to add an enhancement. Change requests can result from any and all
    project activities, including managing requirements, development, testing, customer service, customer review, and
    discussions in the team, and can apply to the tools and process used by the team as well as work products produced by
    the team. The request for change is captured on the backlog of outstanding [Project Work]. During project planning, the
    team reviews the backlog, prioritizes work, and decides which changes will be implemented next.
</p>
<p>
    Begin by reviewing the <a class="elementLink"
    href="./../../../practice.mgmt.team_change_mgmt.base/tasks/request_change_A048C387.html"
    guid="_0mwzEclgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Request Change</a> task and associated guidance. Next, review the Iterative Development
    practice to understand how requests for change are captured and managed on the <a class="elementLink"
    href="./../../../core.mgmt.common.extend_supp/workproducts/work_items_list_39D03CC8.html"
    guid="_rGNWsCbSEdqh1LYUOGRh2A">Work Items List</a>.
</p>
<p>
    If more formal change control is required, you may define a new practice, or re-use existing commercially available
    practices. To define your own practice, begin by defining which roles will review, assign, implement, verify, and close
    change requests. An explicit change request artifact, which includes a definition of the various lifecycle states of a
    change request, may be of value for status reporting. Finally, define the tasks and associated roles that transition
    the change request between the lifecycle states defined previously.
</p>
<h3>
    Common pitfalls
</h3>
<p>
    <b>Too much process.</b> Too much overhead in reviewing, approving, and verifying a change request may slow down the
    team. Simple changes should be possible with minimum overhead.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Too little process.</b> If not properly managed, changes can lead to scope creep, cost growth, schedule slippage,
    dashed expectations, and project cancellation.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Poorly integrated configuration management.</b> In order to understand the impact of changes and to plan for
    verification, change requests must identify which versions of which artifacts were affected by the change. A common
    problem with stand-alone change management practices and tools is a lack of traceability to the affected configuration
    items.
</p>
<p>
    Unfortunately, as mentioned previously, there is no "one-size-fits-all" solution for change management. One possible
    compromise is to classify change requests in two categories:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Change requests that have high risk or cost associated with them, or those that impact stakeholder expectations,
        undergo a more formal change process (including stakeholder review and approval).
    </li>
    <li>
        Change requests that are relatively low risk, or those that do not impact stakeholder requirements, can undergo a
        more light-weight change process.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    This approach is common on large projects, and the two categories are commonly referred to as Class 1 change requests
    (which require a more formal change process involving stakeholders) and Class 2 change requests (which are under the
    control of the development team).
</p>
<p>
    Finally, the appropriate choice of tools will greatly reduce the overhead associated with change management and
    traceability.

    Background
</h3>
<p>
    Change requests typically have a lifecycle. They are raised, reviewed, accepted or rejected, implemented, verified, and
    closed. These states define the status of the change request at a particular point in time, and represent critical
    information for tracking progress. Other sets of states are possible.
</p>
<p>
    During review of a change request, the goal is to assess the technical, cost, and schedule impact of implementing the
    change. The technical impact assessment includes the determination of which work products are affected and an estimate
    of the level of effort required to change and verify all affected artifacts. This information becomes the basis of the
    cost and schedule impact assessments and, ultimately, whether the change request will be accepted or rejected.
</p>
<p>
    If accepted, the implementation and verification of the change request will be assigned to an iteration in the same
    manner as any other work item.
</p>
<p>
    The current process uses the <a class="elementLinkWithType"
    href="./../../../core.mgmt.common.extend_supp/workproducts/work_items_list_39D03CC8.html"
    guid="_rGNWsCbSEdqh1LYUOGRh2A">Artifact: Work Items List</a> to capture, prioritize, and track the change requests
    using the attributes defined for that artifact.
</p>
<h3>
    Submitting change requests
</h3>
<p>
    When submitting a change request, provide as much information as possible to enable a speedy review and disposition. At
    a minimum, all change requests should include the following information:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>ID:</strong> A unique identifier for the change request to simplify tracking. If you are using some form of
        change tracking tool the tool will assign a unique ID.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Brief Description:</strong> A name that summarizes the change request.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Detailed Description:</strong> A detailed description of the change request. For a defect, if you can
        provide information that will help reproduce the defect please do so. For an enhancement request, provide a
        rationale for the request.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Affected Item:</strong> The affected artifact and version.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Severity:</strong> How severe is this issue (show stopper, nice to have, and so on)?
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Priority:</strong> How important this request is, in your opinion.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Depending upon the system you are using, the names of these data elements may differ. However, this information is
    required, in one form or another, to permit speedy review and disposition of the change request.

    This practice describes the simplest possible change management approach, one in which change management is an integral
    part of project management. In this approach, any one may request a change to the system (or supporting artifacts) at
    any time, either to correct a defect identified or to add an enhancement. The request for change is captured on the
    backlog of outstanding [Project Work]. During project planning the team reviews the backlog, prioritizes work and
    decides which changes will be implemented next.

    The best way to read this practice is to first familiarize yourself with its overall structure: what is in it and how&#xD;
    it is organized.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Review the task: &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;

          <Problem>&lt;p>&#xD;
    At any time, any member of the team may uncover defects or propose new requirements that are not in scope for the&#xD;
    iteration. There should be some process for tracking such requests, so that they do not get lost.&amp;nbsp; This practice&#xD;
    simply captures such requests as work items, and assumes that work item management practices will address the&#xD;
    acceptance, assignment, verification, and closure of such requests.&#xD;

    Practices
</h3>
<p>
    Daily meetings are also known as <i>scrum</i> meetings <a class="elementLinkWithUserText"
    href="./../../../core.mgmt.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.mgmt_D80619F3.html#SCH04"
    guid="_JlTPUM6aEdyuBO4ZIzcyig">[SCH04]</a>. These meetings help check the&nbsp;heartbeat of the project. All team
    members are required to attend. The meetings are held in the same place at the same time every work day and
    should&nbsp;not last for more than 15 minutes. Usually, teams conduct the meetings with everyone standing up to keep
    them short (thus some call them "standup" meetings). Anyone who is directly involved&nbsp;can also attend the meeting
    as an observer, but care should be taken because too many people in the meeting may cause disruption or cause people to
    be uncomfortable in sharing information. Typical daily meetings should have 10 people at most.
</p>During the daily meeting, each team member updates peers with answers to the following three questions <a
class="elementLinkWithUserText"
href="./../../../core.mgmt.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.mgmt_D80619F3.html#SCH04"
guid="_JlTPUM6aEdyuBO4ZIzcyig">[SCH04]</a>: 
<ol>
    <li>
        What did I do yesterday?
    </li>
    <li>
        What will I do today?
    </li>
    <li>
        What is impeding my work?
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    These three questions have a specific purpose [<a class="elementLinkWithUserText"
    href="./../../../core.tech.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.tech_6CCF393.html#SUT06"
    guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">SUT06</a>]:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The first question tests the focus of the team. Anything done that was not work planned for the iteration is
        questioned.
    </li>
    <li>
        Answering the second question revises project strategy daily by reorienting the team according to dependency
        changes that were revealed by the response to the previous question.
    </li>
    <li>
        The third question will create issues that may result in new tasks in the Work Items list. The most important
        effect of this question is to create a list of issues that are assigned to the team or to managers.&nbsp;The team
        should expect management to help eliminate bottlenecks.&nbsp;
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    These are the minimum number of questions that satisfy the goals of daily meetings. Experienced practitioners tend to
    add an additional question for improving collaboration among team members: "What have I learned or decided that is of
    relevance to the team?" [<a class="elementLinkWithUserText"
    href="./../../../core.tech.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.tech_6CCF393.html#LAR03"
    guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">LAR03</a>].&nbsp;"What might help or hinder others in meeting their commitments?" [<a
    class="elementLinkWithUserText"
    href="./../../../core.tech.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.tech_6CCF393.html#YIP"
    guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">YIP</a>]. Other topics of discussion (design discussions, chat, and such) should be
    deferred until after the meeting.
</p>
<h4>
    Value
</h4>
<p>
    For self-directed teams, the daily meeting is a mechanism to quickly inform the team about the state of the project and
    people. It supports openness and enables resolution of dependencies and conflicts in real time. It builds a team;
    effective teams are built by regularly communicating, sharing commitments, and helping each other. [<a
    class="elementLinkWithUserText"
    href="./../../../core.tech.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.tech_6CCF393.html#LAR03"
    guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">LAR03</a>]
</p>
<h3>
    What a daily meeting is not
</h3>
<p>
    The daily meeting is not a status update meeting in which the project manager is collecting information about who is
    behind schedule. Rather, it is a meeting in which team members make commitments to each other.<br />
    <br />
    Neither is it a problem-solving nor issue resolution meeting. Issues that are raised are registered and usually dealt
    with by the relevant team members immediately afterward. It is the project manager's responsibility to resolve them as
    quickly as possible or to make sure that someone on the team does.

    A "self-organizing team" has the authority to choose the work that it will perform and the responsibility to do that
    work in the way that it chooses.&nbsp; These are important aspects of a self-organizing team:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>The team selects its own work.</b> At the beginning of a work cycle, the team collectively selects the work from
        the prioritized project work. Work selection is performed within given constraints, including the priorities set by
        stakeholders, time (such as the length of the current work cycle, iteration or project increment), the budget, and
        the skills of team members.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Individuals select their own work.</b> Someone will choose to do something because they are good at it and know
        that they can do the work effectively, because they want to gain more experience at something and hope to improve
        their skills by working with someone with such experience, or because they know that the work needs to be done and
        that it's their turn to do so. Although an individual fulfills one or more roles on a project team, that doesn't
        imply that the person is constrained to doing only specific types of work.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>The team determines how to perform the work.</b> At the beginning of a work cycle, the team holds an "all hands"
        planning meeting where it determines the general strategy for doing the work and the tasks required for that. More
        detailed planning, if required, will be done on a just-in-time&nbsp;basis by the individuals doing the work. Notice
        that the team is still constrained by your organization's standards, technical infrastructure, regulations, and so
        on.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Everyone commits to the work.</b> The team commits to accomplishing the work that it has agreed to do by the end
        of the&nbsp;work cycle. Individuals also commit to doing the work that they say they will do in that cycle,
        although as the&nbsp;time progresses, various tasks may be renegotiated as required.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>The team coordinates regularly.</b> To ensure that the work is accomplished, the team must coordinate its
        efforts effectively. This is typically done through daily standup (scrum) meetings of the team and impromptu
        discussions between individuals.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    This is a participatory approach to decision-making, where everyone has the opportunity to provide input and to listen
    to the decision-making process. The goals are to make decisions at the right place within the organizational structure
    and to empower teams by giving them both the responsibility and the authority to get the job done. Giving them control
    over their work improves motivation among team members and, thereby, their productivity.

    <li>
        <b>Provide leadership.</b> Team culture and project vision must be nurtured and must evolve throughout the project,
        and direction must be provided to the team.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Mediate disagreements.</b> The manager must be prepared to step in and make a decision when other team members
        are unable to reach a decision.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Ensure that team members increase their skill sets.</b> From time to time, the manager may need to motivate
        individuals to take on new tasks that are outside of their comfort zones or to work with others to help those
        people gain new skills.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Ensure that the team respects their limits.</b> Self-organizing teams have the authority to make decisions
        within the scope of their responsibility, but that doesn't mean that they get to rethink everything that they feel
        like changing. For example, the development team must still conform to the technical infrastructure and to the
        business strategy of your organization; they probably do not have the authority to change these things even though
        they may not fully agree with them. When an issue falls outside of their scope of responsibility, the team must
        either accept it or collaborate with the people with the appropriate authority.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Summarize the project plan.</b> External stakeholders, such as senior management or business representatives not
        actively involved with the team, will want to know the current status of the project and the team's current plans.
        The project manager may be required to summarize and communicate this information to those people.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    What "self-organizing" does not mean
</h3>
<p>
    The concept of self-organizing teams often sounds like anarchy or non-management to traditional IT professionals, but
    this is not true. Although self-organization relies on team members being responsible and mature, it is tempered by the
    guiding hand of a good project manager. It is also tempered by organizational standards, infrastructure, and external
    regulations. "Self-organizing" doesn't mean that you have complete freedom to do what you want.
</p>
<p>
    Self-organization isn't necessarily a consensus-based approach either. Sometimes, individuals will disagree with a
    decision but will choose to go along with the will of the team. Consensus decision-making isn't ruled out by this
    approach. but it certainly isn't required.

          <MainDescription><![CDATA[<p>
    <i>Sustainable pace</i> is the rate of work that a team can consistently maintain without burning out team members.
    This concept was popularized by the Extreme Programming (XP) methodology with its 40-hour work week practice, which
    later evolved into the more generic "sustainable pace."&nbsp;The basic idea is that, although a team can have brief
    spurts of overtime (perhaps for a week or two&nbsp;at a time during critical periods during a project lifecycle), it
    cannot maintain that pace indefinitely.&nbsp;This is analogous to the concept that you cannot sprint throughout a
    marathon.
</p>
<p>
    Strategies to help maintain a sustainable pace:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Build activities into everyday work</strong>.&nbsp;This avoids the problem that the activity is scheduled
        into a specific period and, therefore, must&nbsp;be accomplished regardless of how much effort it requires. For
        example, instead of leaving testing to the end of a project, test all the way through the project.&nbsp;Instead of
        modeling only at the beginning of a project, model all the way through only when you need the relevant information
        and only to the extent that you currently need.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Organize the project into short iterations</strong>.&nbsp;Short iterations provide the opportunity for
        small "pebbles" (which show progress) rather than huge "milestones."&nbsp;Continuous feedback reduces
        the&nbsp;need&nbsp;to work long hours. Also,&nbsp;it helps focus on finding ways to consistently achieve the
        regular deliveries.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Adopt a continuous integration strategy</strong>.&nbsp;By frequently merging code, compiling it, testing
        it, and running appropriate code analysis against it, you increase the quality of your work through finding and
        then fixing defects quickly and easily.&nbsp;This reduces the chance of major problems in your work, thereby
        reducing a primary motivator of unexpected overtime.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Question long hours</strong>.&nbsp;Productivity does not increase with hours worked.&nbsp;Tired people are
        far&nbsp;less productive than well-rested ones.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Recognize sustained overtime as a failure</strong>.&nbsp;If a team needs to work overtime for more
        than&nbsp;two weeks in a row, that is a reflection of poor planning or&nbsp;inadequate resources allocation.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Recognize that you're still working hard at a sustainable pace</strong>.&nbsp;Just because you are working
        at a sustainable pace, it&nbsp;doesn't mean that the team is not working hard enough. Rather, it is&nbsp;typically
        an indication that&nbsp;the team is&nbsp;a "well-oiled machine."
    </li>

          <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h3>
    Getting started&nbsp;
</h3>
<p>
    There are several steps to get started with the Whole Team practice.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Understand the underlying philosophies behind this practice.&nbsp;</b><br />
    These philosophies are captured in the&nbsp;<a class="elementLink"
    href="./../../../practice.mgmt.whole_team.base/guidances/guidelines/self_organize_work_assignments_F47FC314.html"
    guid="_rmBEkJjsEduad8I_c-ogIA">Self-Organize Work Assignments</a>,&nbsp;<a class="elementLink"
    href="./../../../practice.mgmt.whole_team.base/guidances/guidelines/maintain_a_sustainable_pace_A132240B.html"
    guid="_KzYHYMLmEdysDsQChI42QQ">Maintain a Sustainable Pace</a>, and&nbsp;<a class="elementLink"
    href="./../../../practice.mgmt.whole_team.base/guidances/guidelines/daily_meetings_3690A7AD.html"
    guid="_251UMCmREdyy6Oss2-0s1g">Daily Meetings</a>&nbsp;guidelines.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    <b>Discuss the implications of this practice with management.&nbsp;</b><br />
    The Whole Team practice often requires changes to the way that projects are managed and&nbsp;governed, because "whole
    teams" are&nbsp;often more self-contained than traditional project teams.&nbsp;For example, with self-organization,
    detailed planning is typically&nbsp;performed at the beginning of each iteration in a just-in-time manner and not at
    the beginning of the project.&nbsp;The implication is that management will receive different and often better-quality
    artifacts at different points in time than from project teams that do not adopt this practice.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Discuss this practice with your team.&nbsp;</b><br />
    The concept of maintaining a sustainable pace is often attractive to&nbsp;team members.&nbsp;But are
    they&nbsp;comfortable with self-organization?&nbsp;Are they comfortable with sharing their current status in daily
    meetings?&nbsp;Do they appreciate how a Whole Team approach can improve their overall productivity?
</p>
<p>
    <b>Identify viable aspects of this practice for your situation.</b><br />
    Your team may not be able to adopt all aspects of this practice.&nbsp;For example, if your project is a high-priority,
    "emergency" project, perhaps you will not be able to adopt a sustainable pace in the short term.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Prioritize your adoption efforts.</b><br />
    Some project teams can adopt this practice all at once, while&nbsp;other teams find that they need to ease into
    self-organization or into daily meetings.&nbsp;Adopt the aspects that are easy for your team right away, and then adopt
    the other aspects one or two at a time, as appropriate, over a period of several weeks.
</p>
<h3>
    Common pitfalls
</h3>
<p>
    There are several common pitfalls that project teams run into when adopting this practice.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Traditional project management culture<br />
    </b> In many ways, the whole team practice is all about pushing many management activities into the hands of the people
    who do the actual work, a philosophy&nbsp;that goes against the grain in some organizations.&nbsp;For example,
    your&nbsp;organization may&nbsp;have a belief system where "managers do the planning; the rest of the staff does what
    they are told" or an "estimation should be left to estimators" mindset. You will need to overcome those kinds
    of&nbsp;beliefs when adopting this practice.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    <b>Insufficient time to change<br />
    </b> It can take weeks, if not months, for experienced professionals to get used to some of the aspects of this
    practice, in particular daily meetings and self-organization.&nbsp;You cannot expect people to change overnight.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Individuals struggle at first to see the "whole team"</strong><br />
    Many people, in particular specialists, are used to working on their own and not as part of an overall team.&nbsp;They
    often struggle to understand why it is&nbsp;important to do so.&nbsp;For example, you may hear people ask why they need
    to participate in&nbsp;a daily meeting when a weekly status report is easier to write.&nbsp;They do not&nbsp;realize
    that it is&nbsp;critical for everyone on the entire team to understand everyone's status, not just for the manager to
    know.&nbsp;Although the individual might be proceeding effectively on one task, they might not realize that several
    others are being blocked by their lack of progress on other tasks that they haven't started yet.&nbsp;

          <MainDescription><![CDATA[<p>
    Whole teams are self-organizing, cross-functional, fluid, and highly collaborative.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    <i>Self-organization</i> means&nbsp;that&nbsp;everyone on the team works together to determine the best way to perform
    the&nbsp;work required fulfilling the goals of the team.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    A <i>whole team</i> is cross-functional, containing people with the combined expertise to perform the work.&nbsp;This
    includes people with modeling skills, testing skills, management skills, and programming skills. It also includes
    stakeholders with the required domain knowledge.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    <i>Fluidity</i> refers to the idea that the team composition will vary over time.&nbsp;For example, at the beginning of
    the project, you may need someone with deep build experience to help organize the team's build strategy, but after this
    work is finished, this person leaves the team.&nbsp;Whole teams work in&nbsp;a highly collaborative manner, adopting
    the most effective communication techniques for their situations and striving to work together as closely as possible.
    It is through collaboration that people make each other better.
</p>
<p>
    The goal of the&nbsp;Whole Team&nbsp;practice is to ensure that:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Everyone has a sense of belonging on the team, of being in it together.</strong>&nbsp;There should be no
        "outsiders," no "them" but only "us."&nbsp;When everyone is on the team,&nbsp;people&nbsp;avoid&nbsp;blaming
        others. Instead, there is&nbsp;a sense of&nbsp;collective ownership.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>The team includes everyone required to build the system.</strong>&nbsp;Ideally, you want a self-contained
        team that has the skills and knowledge to get the job done.&nbsp;Realistically, this is not&nbsp;always possible at
        all points, and sometimes you will need to bring in outside experts for brief periods of time for specific
        goals.&nbsp;For example, you might need someone with experience at setting up the database at the beginning of the
        project or, in the middle of the project, someone with specific expertise in a certain aspect of the domain.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Everyone on the team contributes any way that they can.</strong>&nbsp;With a whole team approach there is a
        move&nbsp;away from specialists who focus on a specific category of work, such as&nbsp;analysis or&nbsp;database
        administration,&nbsp;towards generalizing specialists who may have that expertise&nbsp;but will also work outside
        of their specialty to help&nbsp;address the current need.&nbsp; &nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>The team is self-organizing.</strong>&nbsp;The people best-suited to plan and organize the work are the
        ones who do the work. This results in&nbsp;better estimates (particularly when people know that they'll be held to
        those estimates), more realistic schedules, and increased acceptance of the plan by the team.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong><strong>The team maintains a sustainable pace.</strong></strong>&nbsp; Just as you don't sprint throughout
        a marathon, you can't go for weeks or months at a time working unrealistic levels of overtime.&nbsp;Tired people
        are not productive people.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Everyone works together closely.&nbsp;</strong>Not only is it safer, it is better to ask others for help
        when you need it.&nbsp;Another&nbsp;strategy for improving collaboration within the team is to have daily standup
        (scrum) meetings where you share your current status and explain any problems that you might have.&nbsp;Non-solo
        development practices, such as pair programming and modeling with others, are also common in the Whole Team
        approach.
    </li>

          <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h3>
    Introduction
</h3>
<p>
    <i>Whole Team</i> refers to the organization that delivers software for a project, and it includes any and all
    contributors (both direct and indirect participants) to the delivery. It creates a collaborative environment in which
    the "whole" team participates in setting direction, managing work efforts, and delivering the solution. Successful
    software delivery ultimately depends on people. This dependence means that the way people work together is a critical
    success factor.
</p>
<h4>
    Background
</h4>
<p>
    In some approaches to software development, customers and development managers tell developers what they want, when
    they want it, and how much it can cost. Assignments are handed out and deadlines set without discussion. This
    environment creates resentment among developers, managers, and customers. Developers also are asked or even expected to
    work whatever hours it takes to get the job done. In addition, barriers exist or are created between teams, causing
    team members to blame each other or pass the problem onto someone else.
</p>
<h4>
    Definition
</h4>
<p>
    Whole Team embraces the concept that to be successful in terms of quality, schedule, and scope, people must feel
    empowered to accomplish the project goals. This empowerment also means that the ultimate customer of the software must
    be an active and equal participant in the process. The Whole Team process focuses on the collaboration among all team
    members and the joint decision-making process. This approach creates an environment that ensures transparency and
    promotes collaboration on related work items. Additionally, the active involvement of end users, customers, and
    sponsors in the development process enhances the quality of the delivered product.
</p>
<h4>
    Misconceptions
</h4>
<p>
    Whole team does not mean that the entire team works on everything at once, as the name suggests. The real goal with the
    Whole Team approach is to ensure that the team works collectively to identify risks and to assign, deliver, test, and
    review work products.
</p>
<h4>
    Key aspects
</h4>
<p>
    The Whole Team approach encompasses the following key ideas:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Collaboration across team members through: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Daily meetings
            </li>
            <li>
                Extended-team members
            </li>
            <li>
                Cross-functional teams organized around components
            </li>
            <li>
                Enabling technologies
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Sustainable pace
    </li>
    <li>
        Work assignments are pulled instead of pushed
    </li>
    <li>
        Decision-making is made by people close to the decision
    </li>
    <li>
        Managers do not direct, but coach and lead
    </li>
    <li>
        Everyone participates and generates value
    </li>
    <li>
        Transparency of information and activities
    </li>
    <li>
        Open and honest communication
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Business benefits
</h4>
<p>
    Whole Team practice enriches the software development environment, raising overall resource productivity and improving
    software quality. The Whole Team approach creates transparency, enabling all team members to be aware of all other work
    activities in the software development process. This transparency is of direct benefit to the end user for the software
    product being developed.

    Team members work more effectively if they can influence what they do and how they do it, rather than operating in an
    environment where they are told what to do. Giving the team the ability and responsibility to organize their work and
    determine how to best meet their commitments motivates team members to do their best. This also helps them collaborate
    to ensure that the right skills are applied to the appropriate tasks. Self-organization impacts many areas, including
    how planning and commitments are made (by a team, not by individuals), how work is assigned (you sign up rather than
    get assigned), and how team members view their roles in the project (team member first, job function second).

    guid="_rmBEkJjsEduad8I_c-ogIA">Self-organization</a>&nbsp;requires a few things to work:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Transparency and commitments are crucial to aid in team communication and to bring out the best in the team
        members. Open communication about the team's commitments related to the iteration lifecycle and personal
        commitments made relative to micro increments ensures that execution problems are vetted and the right people are
        focused on solving them.
    </li>
    <li>
        Coaching is required to help teams self-organize and to remove barriers for success. The assumption is that the
        project manager is the coach. This requires that the project manager avoid a command-and-control style of
        management in favor of a coaching style. This has been a key recommendation in management books for the last two
        decades, but some project managers may still not be able to make that transition.

    Ideally, each test cycle should execute all test scripts, but some types of tests are too time-consuming to include in&#xD;
    each test cycle. For manual or time-intensive tests, include test scripts that will provide the most useful feedback&#xD;
    about the maturing solution based on the objectives of the iteration.&#xD;

    Post the test results in a conspicuous place that is accessible to the entire team, such as a white board or Wiki.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For each failing test script, analyze the Test Log to identify the cause of the test failure. Begin with failing tests&#xD;
    that you expected to begin passing against this build, which may indicate newly delivered work items that do not meet&#xD;
    the conditions of satisfaction. Then review previously passing test scripts that are now failing, which may indicate&#xD;
    regressive issues in the build.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        If a test failed because the solution does not meet the conditions of satisfaction for the test case, log the issue&#xD;
        in the Work Items List. In the work item, clearly identify the observed behavior, the expected behavior, and steps&#xD;
        to repeat the issue. Note which failing test initially discovered the issue.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        If a test failed because of a change in the system (such as a user-interface change), but the implementation still&#xD;
        meets the conditions of satisfaction in the test case, update the test script to pass with the new implementation.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        If a test failed because the test script is incorrect (a false negative result) or passed when it was expected to&#xD;
        fail (a false positive result), update the test script to correctly implement the conditions of satisfaction in the&#xD;
        test case. If the test case for a requirement is invalid, create a request change to modify the conditions of&#xD;
        satisfaction for the requirement.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It's best to update test scripts as quickly and continuously as possible. If the change to the test script is trivial,&#xD;
    update the test while analyzing the test results. If the change is a non-trivial task, submit it to the Work Items List&#xD;
    so it can be prioritized against other tasks.&#xD;

    This practice requires a high degree of integration and high-bandwidth communication between developers and testers.
    Given these requirements, the following are the main conditions for applying this practice:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Coverage:</b> Component, feature, and subsystem (or system) testing
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Team considerations:</b> Small team with embedded tester or testers
    </li>
</ul>]]></MainDescription>
          <KeyConsiderations></KeyConsiderations>
          <AdditionalInfo></AdditionalInfo>
          <Application>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Use a multi-prong approach when you review this practice. You can start by focusing on the work products that will be&#xD;
    produced or used during testing and then shift to the tasks involved in processing those artifacts. You might play&#xD;
    different roles within your team. If you are a tester, then you will need to get a very good understanding of the&#xD;
    artifacts, the tasks, and the guidelines supporting them. For a developer, the main points of interest are the&#xD;
    artifacts used within this practice.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Start with the Test artifacts, read their description, and understand when they are used (produced or used), by whom,&#xD;
    and which roles are mainly responsible:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;

    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Switch the focus to tasks and, depending on your main role within the team, review the associated guidelines, concepts&#xD;
    and, if applicable, the tool-related guidance:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

          <Problem>This practice adopts testing throughout an iteration, concurrent with development. This prevents teams from compressing&#xD;
testing into a separate activity at the end of an iteration or release. Concurrent testing reinforces the concept of&#xD;
feature teams working in parallel.</Problem>

    How to adopt this practice
</h3>
<p>
    The following is a list of points that you need to consider when you adopt this practice.
</p>
<p>
    Process scope:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Test coverage:</b> component, feature, and subsystem, or all three
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Focus on the main elements:</b> tasks, artifacts, guidelines
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Team impact:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Team composition:</b> Testers are part of the team, not external resources that are involved only at specific
        points.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Roles:</b> This practice also needs to be adopted by developers to make sure that they provide tested
        components.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Skills:</b> Testers need to adopt a more technical skill set, and developers can also fill the Tester role.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Development approach:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Set a goal of stable builds that can be tested from end-to-end.
    </li>
    <li>
        Provide smaller increments of functionality.
    </li>
    <li>
        Institute "walkthroughs" to determine whether a micro-increment is correct.
    </li>
    <li>
        Build and test frequently throughout an iteration.
    </li>
    <li>
        Make passing automated tests the team's definition of "finished" for a requirement.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Reach a pattern where the team continuously develops micro-increments, tests them, and then regression tests the
    product throughout the day. Obviously, this involves a high degree of regression test automation. Achieving this level
    of automation requires the concerted effort of the whole team, across all the levels of testing, with automated unit,
    integration, system, and acceptance tests.

    Continuous integration is a software development practice that completely rebuilds and tests the application frequently

</p>
<h3>
    Basic steps
</h3>
<p>
    The detailed application of continuous integration depends on which tools you use (configuration management system,
    automated build tool, automated test tool, and so forth). However, these are the basic steps:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        A developer, let's call her Jane, selects a&nbsp;work item&nbsp;to work on.
    </li>
    <li>
        Jane updates her <a class="elementLink"
        href="./../../../practice.tech.continuous_integration.base/guidances/concepts/workspace_722BBA90.html"
        guid="_0cEmAMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Workspace</a> to include the most recent <a class="elementLink"
        href="./../../../core.tech.slot.base/workproducts/technical_implementation_slot_E92F6A39.html"
        guid="_Vux8UEfUEdyiPI8btkmvmw">[Technical Implementation]</a> from the integration workspace.
    </li>
    <li>
        Jane makes her changes in her workspace to both her developer tests and to the implementation, and then she tests
        the changes.
    </li>
    <li>
        Before committing the changes, Jane updates her workspace again (because other developers may have introduced
        conflicting changes) and reruns her developer tests.
    </li>

<h3>
    Constraints
</h3>
<p>
    Conceptually, continuous integration can be performed manually (see <a class="elementLinkWithUserText"
    href="./../../../core.tech.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.tech_6CCF393.html#SHO06"
    guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">[SHO06]</a> for example). However, in practice, there are several constraints that must
    be respected for it to be effective:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        All changes must be introduced into a tested configuration that you know to be good.
    </li>
    <li>
        The integrate-build-test cycle must be fast enough so that it can be completed quickly and the team notified of the
        results. Many published guidelines promote a 10-minute cycle.
    </li>
    <li>
        Keep the <a class="elementLink"
        href="./../../../core.mgmt.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/change_set_430BF233.html"
        guid="_1QU9MAIoEdyLh7vsrHZ4YA">Change Set</a>s&nbsp;small enough so that the work can be completed and integration
        performed several times per day. Many published guidelines promote a 2- to 4-hour cycle between integrations.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    These constraints imply the need for a configuration management (CM) repository to maintain configuration information
    (Item 1 listed previously), automated build and test tools to meet the turnaround constraints (Item 2), and proper
    planning and discipline by developers to ensure that their work items and change sets are small enough to complete
    quickly (Item 3).

    On small teams, shared workspaces may work fine, but you must coordinate activities between team members to avoid
    conflicts.
</p>
<p align="left">
    A better approach is for each developer to have a reasonably private area for the development and testing of their work
    products. This workspace should be insulated&nbsp;so that destabilizing or conflicting changes made by others do not
    interfere with&nbsp;progress. However, it should&nbsp;not be isolated to the extent that&nbsp;the developer's work is
    unavailable to the team.
</p>
<p align="left">
    In addition, insulated&nbsp;workspaces can be created for each test phase, such as integration testing and system
    testing. This approach to workspaces provides several benefits <a class="elementLinkWithUserText"

        <p>
            Developers can develop, test, and debug software changes without being affected by others team
            members'&nbsp;changes until they are ready. When ready, developers can update their insulated environments to
            test the latest changes from other developers.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            With separate workspaces for integration and system testing, a team could use a methodology that ensures
            changes have passed integration testing before other developers get them, thereby minimizing the time spent
            solving integration problems.&nbsp; For example, if two team members check in incompatible changes without
            realizing it, and both changes are immediately available to everyone on the team, all team members&nbsp;might
            waste time trying to resolve the broken build. Conversely, if both changes must pass integration testing before
            being distributed to others, the problem could be found and fixed by one person with minimal disruption to the
            team.

    <li>
        <p>
            By setting up an integration area to collect and build the latest changes, the team can integrate early and

        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            The system test area, which is used for preparing releases, is insulated from developers' ongoing changes and
            contains only configurations that have passed integration testing. This lets you control the content of the
            release while still enabling developers to continue working.

    href="./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/workproducts/build_95D7D8FD.html"
    guid="_0YuXEMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Build</a>. A build is initiated by combining the work completed by one or more
    developers and resolving any conflicts between those changes. Ideally a build is then subjected to a battery of tests
    to determine if it is of sufficient quality to move into production.
</p>
<p>
    As the changes progress from development towards production, its beneficial to know two characteristics:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Test Context</strong>&nbsp;– identifying the elements and their versions that are tested together
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        What changes are in this build (completed work items)
    </li>
    <li>
        What&nbsp;changes are&nbsp;partially in this build (work items that are partially complete)
    </li>
    <li>
        What changes are&nbsp;not in this build (work items that are not reflected at all in this build)
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Verification Level</strong> – identifying what amount of testing is complete.&nbsp; For example,
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Unit Tested
    </li>
    <li>
        Integration Tested
    </li>
    <li>
        System Tested
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The promotion lifecycle coordinates and synchronizes the efforts of the development team. This lifecycle consists of
    the following steps:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Changes are introduced into the system in the form of completed&nbsp;<a class="elementLink"
        href="./../../../core.mgmt.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/change_set_430BF233.html"
        guid="_1QU9MAIoEdyLh7vsrHZ4YA">Change Set</a>s
    </li>
    <li>
        A build is generated clearly identifying the&nbsp;changes included in the build
    </li>
    <li>
        Testing is conducted
    </li>
    <li>
        When testing is successful the changes are marked with the appropriate&nbsp;verification level through labeling,
        baselining or other related techniques.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Ultimately all required testing is complete and a new system&nbsp;increment is ready.
</p>
<p>
    Separate&nbsp;<a class="elementLink"
    href="./../../../practice.tech.continuous_integration.base/guidances/concepts/workspace_722BBA90.html"
    guid="_0cEmAMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Workspace</a>s are often used as the context for each level of testing. As changes are

    href="./../../../practice.tech.continuous_integration.base/guidances/concepts/workspace_722BBA90.html"
    guid="_0cEmAMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Workspace</a>, it is verified for consistency and tested. This ensures that the effort
    of testing a build is applied to the correct&nbsp;set of changes, makes the context for the tests stable,&nbsp;and also
    allows developers to continue working on the next build while the tests are being conducted.
</p>
<p>
    A change promotion lifecycle such as this offers three key benefits
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Reduces effort because there is no reason to execute the tests in the next stages until the&nbsp;changes passes the
        previous stage. For example you would not commit the resources to&nbsp;system testing a build until it
        passes&nbsp;developer tests.
    </li>
    <li>
        Helps to ensure that a change&nbsp;which is moved into production has been subjected to the appropriate level of
        testing first.
    </li>
    <li>
        Simplifies debugging since developers can base their work on a proven&nbsp;set of changes&nbsp;in relative
        isolation from destabilizing changes from other developers

          <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h3>
    Getting started&nbsp;
</h3>
<p>
    The ultimate goal of continuous integration (CI) is to integrate and test the system on every change to minimize the
    time between injecting a defect and correcting it. If the team is new to continuous integration, though, it is best to
    start small and then incrementally add subpractices, as identified in the subsection that follows. For example, start
    with a simple daily integration build and incrementally add tests and automated inspections (code coverage, and so
    forth) to the build process, over time. As the team begins to adopt the sub-practices increase the build frequency. The
    following subpractices provide guidance in adopting CI.
</p>
<h4>
    Developer practices
</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Make changes available frequently.</b> For CI to be effective, <a class="elementLink"
        href="./../../../core.mgmt.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/change_set_430BF233.html"
        guid="_1QU9MAIoEdyLh7vsrHZ4YA">Change Set</a>s need to be small, complete, cohesive, and <em>available</em> for
        integration. Keep change sets small so that they can be completed and tested in a relatively short time span.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Don't break the build.</b> Test your changes by using a private build before making your changes available.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Fix broken builds immediately.</b> When a problem is identified, fix it as soon as possible, while it is still
        fresh in your mind. If the problem cannot be quickly resolved, back out (do not complete) the changes.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Integration practices
</h4>
<p>
    A build is more than a compile (compilation). A build consists of compilation, testing, inspection, and deployment.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Provide feedback</b> as quickly as possible.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Automate the build process</b> so that it is fast and repeatable and so that issues are identified and conveyed
        to the appropriate person for resolution as quickly as possible.
    </li>
</ul>

        Commit your build scripts to the CM repository so they are controlled and available to the rest of the team.
        Automated builds are highly recommended, both for private builds and integration builds. Builds need to be

    <li>
        Invest in a CI server.The goal of continuous integration is to integrate, build, and test the software in a clean
        environment any time that there is a change to the implementation. Although a dedicated CI server is not essential,
        it will greatly reduce the overhead required to integrate continuously and provide the required reporting.

<h3>
    Common pitfalls
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>A build process that doesn't identify problems.</b> A build is more that a simple compilation (or its dynamic
        language variations). Sound testing and inspection practices, both developer testing and integration testing, must
        be adopted also to ensure the right amount of coverage.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Integration builds that take too long to complete.</b> The build process must balance coverage with speed. You
        don't have to run every system level acceptance test to meet the intent of CI. Staged builds will provide a useful
        means to organize testing to get the balance coverage and speed.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Change sets that are too large.</b> Developers must develop the discipline and skills to organize their work
        into small, cohesive change sets. This will simplify testing, debugging, and reporting. It will also ensure that
        changes are made available frequently enough to meet the intention of continuous integration.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Failure to commit defects to the CM repository.</b> Ensure adequate testing by developers before making change
        sets available.
    </li>
</ul>]]></MainDescription>

    The essence of continuous integration
</h3>
<p>
    The essence of continuous integration can be described by the following activities:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Developers make small changes to the latest integration-tested implementation in their workspaces, and they unit
        test them before making the changes available to the team.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>
        Change sets from all developers are integrated in an integration workspace and tested frequently (at least daily--
        ideally any time a new change set is available).
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The first activity ensures that changes are made to a configuration that is known to be good and tested before making
    the changes available. The second activity identifies integration issues early so that they can be corrected while the
    change is still fresh in the developer's mind.

    The best way to read this practice is to first familiarize yourself with its overall structure: what is in it and how&#xD;
    it is organized.&amp;nbsp; Then begin by reviewing the key concepts to understand the terminology. Next, review the &lt;a&#xD;

          <Problem>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The effort required to integrate a system increases exponentially with time. By integrating the system more frequently,&#xD;
    integration issues are identified earlier, when they are easier to fix, and&amp;nbsp;the overall integration effort is&#xD;
    reduced.&amp;nbsp; The result is a higher-quality product and more predictable delivery schedules.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Continuous integration provides the following benefits:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Improved feedback.&lt;/b> Continuous integration shows constant and demonstrable progress.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Improved error detection.&lt;/b> Continuous integration enables you to detect and address errors early, often&#xD;
        minutes after they've been injected into the product. Effective continuous integration requires automated unit&#xD;
        testing with appropriate code coverage.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Improved collaboration.&lt;/b> Continuous integration enables team members to work together safely. They know that&#xD;
        they can make a change to their code, integrate the system, and determine very quickly whether or not their change&#xD;
        conflicts with others.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Improved system integration.&lt;/b> By integrating continuously throughout your project, you know that you can&#xD;
        actually build the system, thereby mitigating integration surprises at the end of the lifecycle.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Reduced&amp;nbsp;number of parallel changes&lt;/b> that need to be merged and tested.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Reduced number of errors&lt;/b> found during system testing. All conflicts&amp;nbsp;are resolved before making new&#xD;
        change sets available and by the person who is in the best position to resolve them.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Reduced technical risk.&lt;/b> You always have an up-to-date system to test against.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Reduced management risk.&lt;/b> By continuously integrating your system, you know exactly how much functionality&#xD;
        that you have built to date, thereby improving your ability to predict when and if you are actually going to be&#xD;
        able to deliver the necessary functionality.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></Problem>

    This task focuses on envisioning the initial architecture and outlining the&nbsp;architectural decisions that will
    guide development and testing. It relies on gathering experience gained in similar systems or problem domains to
    constrain and focus the architecture so that effort is not wasted in re-inventing architecture.
</p>
<p>
    The results are captured for future reference and are communicated across the team. It is important that the team has
    enough information to understand the technical approach being taken.
</p>
<p>
    The architecture evolves organically over time by outlining and refining portions of it. A few people get together in a
    room and sketch out what they think the architecture will be. This envisioning effort sets the foundation for
    prototyping. If the solution is similar to a previously produced solution (or is a well-known solution domain), then it
    will probably be good enough to reference that example as evidence of the feasibility of the approach. In some cases,
    it may be necessary to develop one or more prototypes to validate some of the decisions or clarify some of the
    requirements.
</p>
<p>
    The work done here does not seek to produce a detailed and comprehensive technical specification for the system.
    Rather, the approach should be to decide the overall technical approach at a high level. The conclusion of this work
    should produce just enough information to communicate the architecture to the team, and to demonstrate its viability to
    the customer. This allows the project to move forward, enabling you to refine and baseline the architecture.

    It is critical that this task be performed collaboratively with active involvement of other team members and project
    stakeholders so that consensus and common understanding is reached. It is particularly vital to involve the
    developer(s) throughout this task. The architecture effort&nbsp;is about providing leadership and coordination of the
    technical work rather than putting in a solo performance.

    Decide how to partition the software, both in logical and physical terms. Partitioning your system helps you manage its&#xD;

    manageable pieces, you make development easier.&#xD;

    As a minimum, decide on:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        How to partition the software when managing development (the use of layering as a partitioning strategy, for&#xD;

    Continue the collaboration with the whole&nbsp;team on the refining of the architecture in order to promote consensus
    and a common understanding of the overall solution. The architect should be working to coordinate and guide the
    technical activities of the team rather than doing all the work alone.&nbsp;Place special emphasis&nbsp;on
    involving&nbsp;the developer(s) throughout this task since it's the developed solution that will prove out the
    architecture and may result in refinements to the architecture documentation.
</p>
<p>
    Ensure that those who need to act upon the architectural work&nbsp;understand&nbsp;it and are able to work with
    it.&nbsp;Make sure that the description of the architecture clearly conveys not only the solution but also the
    motivation and objectives related to the&nbsp;decisions that have been made in shaping the architecture. This will make
    it easier for others to understand the architecture and to adapt it over time.

        to the patterns.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Identifying components will help hide the complexity of the system and help you work at a higher level. Components need&#xD;
    to be internally cohesive and to provide external services through a limited interface.&amp;nbsp; At this point, interfaces&#xD;
    do not need to be as detailed as a signature, but they do need to document what the elements need, what they can use,&#xD;
    and what they can depend on.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Component identification can be&amp;nbsp;based on architectural layers, deployment choices, or key abstractions. Ask&#xD;
    yourself these questions:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What is logically or functionally related (same use case or service, for example)?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What entities provide services to multiple others?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What entities depend on each other? Strongly or weakly?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What entities should you be able to exchange independently from others?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What will run on the same processor or network node?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What parts are constrained by similar performance requirements?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    When you identify a component be sure to briefly describe the functionality that should be allocated to the components.&#xD;

          <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h3>
    Getting started&nbsp;
</h3>
<p>
    Begin by making sure that the team and key stakeholders understand what software architecture is and the value of
    capturing it in a separate artifact. See <a class="elementLinkWithType"
    href="./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/software_architecture_59A08DE0.html"
    guid="__O7tAMVvEduLYZUGfgZrkQ">Concept: Software Architecture</a>.
</p>
<p>
    After there is agreement that the architectural information should be captured, it is important to come to an agreement
    on what architectural information you want to capture and what format it should take. Review the <a
    class="elementLinkWithType"
    href="./../../../practice.tech.evolutionary_arch.base/workproducts/architecture_notebook_9BB92433.html"
    guid="_0XAf0MlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Artifact: Architecture Notebook</a> and associated guidance. Agree on what you want to
    document.
</p>
<p>
    Next, review <a class="elementLinkWithType"
    href="./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/arch_views_viewpoints_7A6CD31.html"
    guid="_kgtcoNc8Edyd7OybSySFxg">Concept: Architectural Views and Viewpoints</a> and <a class="elementLinkWithType"
    href="./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/arch_mechanism_2932DFB6.html"
    guid="_mzxI0A4LEduibvKwrGxWxA">Concept: Architectural Mechanism</a>. Both are crucial to understanding how to define
    and communicate the architecture.
</p>
<p>
    Now you can turn your attention to deciding, as a team, how and when the architectural tasks should be performed.

<h3>
    Common pitfalls
</h3>
<p>
    The architect should not work in isolation and just throw an architectural specification over the wall to the
    developers. This requires too much documentation and makes it difficult for team members to understand why the
    architecture needs to work the way it does. Building the architecture is an activity that requires collaboration to be
    successful.
</p>
<p>
    Avoid creating significant and detailed architectural documentation for agile projects. Don't get caught up in defining
    exactly what the structure of the Architecture Notebook should be. Focus on capturing the key decisions and the
    rationale for these decisions. Refer to more detailed documentation where necessary, and don't duplicate material. Keep
    the documentation clear and concise. Make sure that the people who use the architecture (the development team) are
    comfortable with the format and content of the architecture. Is there more or different information that they would
    like to see? Would they like to see less, instead?
</p>
<p>
    Document important decisions. Team members may be close by and you may be in constant contact with them, but teams
    change and software architects move on to other projects. Failure to document important decisions raises the risk of
    failure later because future team members won't have the benefit of being involved in today's collaborative decisions.
    Consider future team members as collaborators that you simply don't have the opportunity to speak to face-to-face.

    It provides a place for maintaining the list of architectural issues, along with the associated architectural
    decisions, designs, patterns, code documented (or pointed to), and so forth -- all at appropriate levels to make it
    easy to understand what architectural decisions have been made and remain to be made.
</p>
<p>
    It is helpful for architects to use this artifact to collaborate with other team members in developing the architecture
    and to help team members understand the motivation behind architectural decisions so that those decisions can be
    robustly implemented. For example, the architect may put constraints on how data is packaged and communicated between
    different parts of the system. This may appear to be a burden, but the justification in the Architecture Notebook can
    explain that there is a significant performance bottleneck when communicating with a legacy system. The rest of the
    system must adapt to this bottleneck by following a specific data packaging scheme.
</p>
<p>
    This artifact should also inform the team members how the system is partitioned or organized so that the team can adapt
    to the needs of the system. It also gives a first glimpse of the system and its technical motivations to whoever must
    maintain and change the architecture later.<br />

    Team members who were not involved in those architectural decisions need to understand the reasoning behind the context&#xD;
    of the architecture so that they can address the needs of the system. Consider adding more information when&#xD;
    appropriate. A small project shouldn't spend a lot of time documenting the architecture, but all critical elements of&#xD;
    the system must be communicated to current and future team members. This is all useful content:&#xD;

    The essence of evolutionary architecture
</h3>
<p>
    In the Evolutionary Architecture practice, you analyze the major technical concerns that affect the solution and
    document architectural decisions to ensure that you have assessed and communicated those decisions.
</p>
<h3>
    The key principles of the Evolutionary Architecture practice are:

<ul type="disc">
    <li class="MsoNormal c3">
        <strong><span class="c1">Perform architecture work "just in time" for all other work.</span></strong> <span
        class="c1">When planning your project, identify and discuss architectural issues with your team, and then
        prioritize architectural work with any other work.</span> Base your priorities on mitigating technical risk rather
        than creating value. Deferring architectural issues to handle them "just in time" enables the architecture to

    The best way to read this practice is to first familiarize yourself with its overall structure: what is in it and how&#xD;
    it is organized.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Next, review the key concepts for the practice. An especially important concept is &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/software_architecture_59A08DE0.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;__O7tAMVvEduLYZUGfgZrkQ&quot;>Concept: Software Architecture&lt;/a>. After you understand what architecture is, turn your&#xD;
    attention to the Architecture Notebook. Then review the tasks, accessing guidelines and tool mentors associated with&#xD;
    each task as needed. You can also access the guidance provided by the practice directly through the Guidance folder.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Be sure to take a look at the list of enablement materials for additional sources of information. See the Additional&#xD;
    Resources section of this page.&#xD;

          <Problem>&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;>The Evolutionary Architecture practice describes how to incrementally build and improve the software&#xD;
    architecture while uncovering and addressing architectural issues during software development. This reduces technical&#xD;
    risk without requiring significant up-front architectural effort.&lt;/span>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;>This practice:&lt;/span>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Improves quality and productivity by reducing the need to make time-consuming, error-prone fixes to late-detected&#xD;
        problems that result from architectural flaws. This is possible because the architecture is validated early, and&#xD;
        key architectural problems are corrected before the majority of development is done.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Reduces time to market by focusing on reuse. It improves the consistency and maintainability of the system by&#xD;
        incorporating lessons learned from development back into the architecture and applying those lessons to the rest of&#xD;
        development.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;

            &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;>Improves predictability by identifying and implementing the highest-risk technical areas&#xD;
            first.&lt;/span> It improves the team's responsiveness to change by shortening the architectural cycle and&#xD;
            minimizing time wasted in architectural scrap and rework when changes arise.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></Problem>

    EPF base
</h3>
<h4>
    1.5.1
</h4>
<p>
    Bugzilla 313572: Emphasized the agile nature of envisioning and modeling the architecture.
</p>
<p>
    Other minor fixes.
</p>
<h4>
    1.5
</h4>
<p>
    This is the first version of this practice, included as part of the EPF 1.5 practices library. It is derived primarily
    from OpenUP 1.0 content, and it includes refinements to structure the content into a practice and clean up content to
    remove redundancy and improve consistency.
</p>
<p>
    The following specific changes were made:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Created plug-ins and content packages to support practice library structure -- separate base and assign practice
        plug-ins, separate role definition plug-in, and so forth.
    </li>
    <li>
        Implemented delayed role assignment. Placed Architect role in new role definition plug-in. Moved all role
        assignments and assignments of tasks and work products to standard categories to new assign plug-in.
    </li>
    <li>
        Implemented default navigation view approach. Mapped all elements to the navigation view building blocks so that
        they are included in a view
    </li>
    <li>
        Removed term definitions for roles and work products, because their definitions are enough.
    </li>
    <li>
        Changed name of <i>Task: Outline the Architecture</i> to <i>Task: Envision the Architecture</i>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Changed the name of <i>Task: Refine the Architecture</i> to <i>Task: Evolve the Architecture</i>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Identified guidance that can be shared between architectural tasks and practices and defined the appropriate
        practice elements in the common architectural guidance package in a separate, common plug-in
        (core.tech.common.base).
    </li>
    <li>
        Reviewed and re-factored tasks. Moved task details to guidance, where it can be shared between architectural tasks
        and practices.
    </li>
    <li>
        Placed all content related to visual modeling in separate content package, both in the common plug-ins and in the
        practice plug-ins.
    </li>
    <li>
        Created new elements that are common to all practices: Custom category with a description of "title page" for the
        practice, How to Adopt page, Release Info page, and so on.
    </li>
    <li>
        Removed association with guidance from the architecture discipline. It is just a standard category. All guidance is
        associated with roles, tasks, work products (or other guidance).
    </li>
    <li>
        Cleaned up the content to reflect the latest authoring guidelines:
    </li>
    <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
        <ul>
            <li>
                Removed references to specific roles in all elements
            </li>
            <li>
                Removed references to specific method assets (for example, OpenUP) and specific lifecycles (such as RUP
                phases) from the method element descriptions.
            </li>
            <li>
                Replaced references to artifacts outside of the practice with references to the appropriate slots.
            </li>
            <li>
                Eliminated redundancy among tasks, concepts, and guidance. In many cases, this led to the deletion of
                several guidance pages and the addition of several common guidance pages.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The following method elements were added:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Key concepts, so they can be shared: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Concept: Analysis Mechanism
            </li>
            <li>
                Concept: Architectural Goals
            </li>
            <li>

          <MainDescription><![CDATA[<p>
    Designing a system is about creating the internal structure and behavior of a system that's robust, extensible, and
    high-quality. Good design improves quality and makes a system easier to maintain and extend, while a poor design can
    significantly raise the cost of producing and maintaining the software.
</p>
<p>
    Design is an abstraction of the code that presents the system from a perspective that makes it easier to address the
    structure and behavior of the software. This can be done through viewing the code, but it's more difficult and less
    effective to address structural and behavioral issues this way. Design can be visual models, simple sketches, text
    descriptions, etc. The critical element of design is that it describes how different elements of the system interact to
    fulfill the requirements.
</p>
<p>
    The amount of design that's formally documented and maintained will vary depending on the criticality of the design and
    how much of the design needs to be communicated to future team members. At a minimum, all architecturally significant
    design elements should be documented and kept up-to-date with the implementation. These are critical aspects of the
    system that are necessary for the understanding and maintenance of the software. Other important or complex structure
    and behavior may be maintained as well. And some contracts may require that the entire design is thoroughly documented.
</p>
<p>
    On many projects there will probably be aspects of the design that are only documented for the purpose of creating a
    solution or walking through how certain behavior will be realized. It may not be worth the overhead of maintaining this
    information as the design is transformed through refactoring and other influences. However, it may be useful to archive
    the initial decisions, whiteboard images, or files so they can be referenced in the future if necessary. These can be
    viewed as "old meeting minutes" that are stored for potential future reference. They may not reflect the current
    design, but they may still provide useful insight.
</p>
<h3>
    Multiple Passes
</h3>
<p>
    The design will be revisited many times throughout an iterative lifecycle and even within an iteration. Each time some
    design activity is being performed, it will be performed in the context of a specific goal. The goal might be to
    identify a notional set of participants in a collaboration that can be exercised to realize the behavior required (an
    analysis pass). The goal might be in the identification of some coarse-grained elements that are required to act out
    some scenario (an architectural pass). Then a pass might be done within one of those components to identify the
    elements within that will collaborate together to perform the behavior required (a more detailed design pass).<br />
    <br />
    Design might be performed in a particular context such as database context, user-interface context, or perhaps the
    context of how some existing library will be applied. In these cases the design steps will be performed just to make
    and communicate decisions regarding that context
</p>
<p>
    Avoid analysis paralysis. Avoid refining, extending, and improving the design beyond a minimal version that suffices to
    cover the needs of the requirements within the architecture. Design should be done in small chunks, proven via
    implementation, improved via refactoring, and integrated into the baseline to provide value to the stakeholders.
</p>
<h3>
    Design versus Architecture
</h3>
<p>
    Design is a real thing, the construction of the system's structure and behavior. Architecture defines principles,
    contexts, and constraints on the system's construction. Architecture is described in architecture artifacts, but it's
    realized as design (visual or otherwise) and implementation.<br />
    <br />
    One way to look at architecture is that it helps to make the entire design more cohesive with itself by balancing the
    needs of the entire system. Design tends to focus on one area at a time. Architecture helps assure the design is
    consistent and appropriate to the goals of the system. For instance, there may be constraints placed on most of the
    design to support the performance of one part of the system, such as improving access to a legacy system. Failure to
    conform to those constraints in the design may cause the system to fail to meet the performance requirements of the
    legacy system access. Conforming to the architecture assures that all the goals of the system are met by balancing
    competing technical issues.
</p>
<h3>
    Quality of Design
</h3>
<h4>
    You Aren't Going to Need It
</h4>
<p>
    The YAGNI principle is a good general approach to design. While designs should be robust enough to modify, re-use, and
    maintain, it should also be as simple as possible. One of the ways to keep it simple is to make few assumptions about
    what the design's going to need in the future. Don't assume you'll need something until you know you need it, then do a
    good job of adding it. Add what's needed for the current requirement or iteration. Refactor the design as necessary
    when more functionality needs to be added or the design must be made more complex to deal with new circumstances.
</p>
<h4>
    Coupling and Cohesion
</h4>
<p>
    Two of the most fundamental principles of design are coupling and cohesion. A good design contains elements that have
    high cohesion and low coupling. High cohesion means that a single element, such as a class or subsystem, is composed of
    parts that are closely related or work closely together to fulfill some purpose. Low coupling means that the elements
    of a system have a minimum of dependencies on each other. A single element such as a subsystem should be easily
    replaceable by another subsystem that provides similar behavior.<br />
    <br />
    For example, in a payroll system an Employee class would have high cohesion if it contained elements and functions such
    as Name, Tax ID Number, and Monthly Salary. At first, it may seem as if the Calculate Paycheck functional would also be
    cohesive. But when you consider that hourly employees must be paid overtime, sales people must have commission
    calculated for them, etc, the function is less related to Employee and should probably be its own class or
    subsystem.<br />
    <br />
    An example of low coupling would be if the Calculate Paycheck subsystem can be easily replaced by third party that may
    be more robust and offer more features.<br />
    <br />
    Coupling and cohesion are so important to be aware of because they arise in so many design principles and design
    strategies such as patterns.
</p>
<h4>
    Open-Closed Principle
</h4>
<p>
    Elements in the design should be "open" for extension but "closed" for modification. The goal of this principle is to
    create software than can be extended without changing code&nbsp;<a class="elementLinkWithUserText"
    href="./../../../core.tech.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.tech_6CCF393.html#MEY97"
    guid="_9ToeIB83Edqsvps02rpOOg">[MEY97]</a>. This is because every change to software runs the risk of introducing bugs
    into code that's already correct. It also allows functionality to be re-used without having to know the details of the
    implementation, reducing the time it takes to create something new. Keeping this principle in mind helps make a design
    more maintainable.<br />

          <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h3>
    Identification of elements
</h3>
<p>
    Identify the elements, based on the needs of the requirements. The identification of elements can stem from a static
    perspective of walking through the requirements and identifying elements clearly called out, which is a form of domain
    modeling. This can pull in other elements identified as being in the application domain or deemed necessary from
    examining the requirements for the portion of the system being designed. This identification can also pull from key
    abstractions identified while defining the architecture.
</p>
<p>
    The identification of elements should also apply a dynamic perspective by walking through scenarios of use of the
    system (or subsystem) and identifying elements needed to support the behavior. That behavior might be a scenario of use
    from an external user perspective or, while designing a subsystem, a responsibility assigned to the subsystem that has
    complex algorithmic behavior. Consider applying the <a class="elementLink"
    href="./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/guidelines/entity_control_boundary_pattern_C4047897.html"
    guid="_uF-QYEAhEdq_UJTvM1DM2Q">Entity-Control-Boundary Pattern</a> to identify the elements necessary to support the
    scenario, or apply other patterns identified in the architecture that specify the elements that will be used to support
    specific aspects of the scenario.
</p>
<p>
    If you are designing a real-time system, include elements to represent events and signals that allow you to describe
    the asynchronous triggers of behavior to which the system must respond. <b>Events</b> are specifications of interesting
    occurrences in time and space that usually (if they are noteworthy) require some response from the system.
    <b>Signals</b> represent asynchronous mechanisms used to communicate certain types of events within the system.
</p>
<p>
    If there are existing elements from previous passes over the design or from selected frameworks or other reusable
    elements, reuse them whenever possible. See <a class="elementLinkWithType"
    href="./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/guidelines/software_reuse_B6B04C26.html"
    guid="_vO2uoO0OEduUpsu85bVhiQ">Guideline: Software Reuse</a>.
</p>
<p>
    After identifying the elements, give each one meaningful name. Each element should also have a description, so that the
    team members who work together to refine the design and implement from the design will understand the role that each
    element plays.
</p>
<p>
    Based on this information, the identification of elements could be applied several times in designing just one part of
    the system. Although there is no one correct strategy for multiple passes, they could be done at a coarse-grained level
    and then a fine-grained level, or at an analysis (abstract) level and then a design level.
</p>
<h3>
    Behavior of elements
</h3>
<p>
    To identify the behavior of the elements, go through scenarios and assign behavior to the appropriate collaborating
    participants. If a particular use of the system or subsystem can have multiple possible outcomes or variant sequences,
    cover enough scenarios to ensure that the design is robust enough to support the possibilities.
</p>
<p>
    When assigning behavior to elements, consider applying the <a class="elementLink"
    href="./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/guidelines/entity_control_boundary_pattern_C4047897.html"
    guid="_uF-QYEAhEdq_UJTvM1DM2Q">Entity-Control-Boundary Pattern</a>&nbsp;or other patterns identified in the
    architecture.
</p>
<p>
    Behavior can be represented as a simple statement of responsibility, or it can be a detailed operation specification.
    Use the appropriate level of detail to communicate important design decisions while giving the freedom to make
    appropriate implementation decisions as those tasks ensue.
</p>
<p>
    Avoid too much identification of behavior solely from the perspective of domain modeling. Include only behavior that is
    really needed -- behavior identified by going through required scenarios of system use.
</p>
<p>
    Behavior must be understood as a responsibility of an element, as well as an interaction between two elements in the
    context of some broader behavior of the system or subsystem. The latter part of this will lead the developer to
    identify relationships that are necessary between the elements.
</p>
<h3>
    Design element relationships
</h3>
<p>
    The relationships between the elements necessary for the behavior must be designed. This can simply be the
    identification of the ability to traverse from one element to another or else a need to manage an association between
    the elements. Relationships can be designed in more detail, as appropriate. This can include: optionality,
    multiplicity, whether the relationship is a simple dependency or managed association, and so on. These decisions that
    drive implementation details are best made at the design level, where it is easier to see how all of the pieces fit
    together.
</p>
<p>
    Avoid defining too many relationships based on relationships in the application domain. Include only relationships that
    are needed based on the requirements. On the other hand, a combination of requirements knowledge and domain knowledge
    can lead to some detailed decisions on the relationships, such as optionality and multiplicity.
</p>
<h3>
    Analysis classes and YAGNI
</h3>
<p>
    Analysis classes are used to identify initial buckets where system functionality should go. They're the first pass at
    understanding where system behavior will be realized in the design and implementation. For example, an entity class
    might initially represent all of the behavior for an employee, such as storing personal information and calculating the
    value of a paycheck. Few assumptions are made about how the final design will look at this point. Analysis classes are
    about making sure required behavior is represented somewhere in the system, rather than about creating a perfect
    design.
</p>
<p>
    Analysis classes allow you to begin designing from abstractions, so that the details of the system depend on those
    abstractions and not the other way around. In the Employee class, the notion of an employee should start with the idea
    of someone who works for the company, who has responsibilities and receives benefits. It's easier to create a design
    from this simple idea. The complexity of the design should emerge from the abstract ideas of what the design needs to
    do. This will also help keep coupling low and cohesion high.
</p>
<p>
    YAGNI (You Aren't Going to Need It) is an approach to design where the developer creates only enough implementation and
    design to address the required functionality. No assumptions are made about re-use or possible future uses of the
    software. Software is improved when the system requirements demand more functionality or robustness.
</p>
<p>
    The first classes created from a YAGNI perspective are much like analysis classes. You don't know how complex it may be
    to calculate a paycheck for your employee, so you assume that functionality is highly cohesive with the rest of what
    the Employee class must do. As you understanding of the requirement develops, the analysis class evolves into a set of
    collaborating classes and patterns that better support the behavior of the system. For example, payroll calculations
    could be moved into a pattern that handles all of the different types of paycheck calculations (overtime, commissions,
    and so forth), thereby increasing the internal cohesion of the class.
</p>
<p>
    Use analysis classes to define an initial place to put system behavior, and add only enough behavior to satisfy the
    YAGNI perspective. Analysis classes will evolve into concrete design classes as more behavior is added and as the
    design is refactored. See <a class="elementLinkWithType"

    Review the design
</h3>
<p>
    Design is best accomplished collaboratively, because it is a problem-solving activity with a range of&nbsp;parts and
    perspectives. There should be a constant level of review to ensure that the decisions make sense within the area being
    designed and in the design of the system overall. There also might be occasions where some area of design is reviewed
    by a set of interested or knowledgeable parties, such as the architect who will verify that the design conforms to an
    architectural decision or a developer who will be expected to implement the design.
</p>
<p>
    The design should be examined to ensure that it follows heuristics of quality design, such as loose coupling and high
    cohesion. Responsibilities should be appropriately distributed to elements in ways that there are no elements with too
    much responsibility and no elements that are left without any responsibilities. The design should be able to clearly
    communicate the design decisions, yet not delve into concerns best dealt with during implementation of code.
</p>
<p>
    Ensure that the design follows any project-specific guidelines and conforms to the architecture. Modifications to the
    design to improve it (based on issues identified in reviewing it) should apply <a class="elementLink"
    href="./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/guidelines/refactoring_F3D63EBD.html"
    guid="_YNx2sJ05EdyQ3oTO93enUw">Refactoring</a>&nbsp;to ensure that the design and any existing implementation of the
    design continues to fulfill its responsibilities.
</p>Revisit the relationships between elements to improve the coupling in the design. Remove redundant relationships, try
to make relationships unidirectional, and so forth. See <a class="elementLinkWithType"
href="./../../../practice.tech.evolutionary_design.base/guidances/guidelines/analyze_the_design_4C4750C0.html"
guid="__MnggPTdEduDKIuqTXQ8SA">Guideline: Analyze the Design</a> for more information. 
<h3>
    Refine the design
</h3>
<p>
    After creating an implementation that includes a set of collaborating elements, with the behavior and relationships
    robust enough to pass developer tests, the design can be improved and transformed into a more robust and maintainable
    system.
</p>
<p>
    The visibility of each operation should be selected to be as restrictive as possible. Based on walking through the
    scenario, it should be clear which operations must be available to other elements in the design and which can be
    considered behavior inside of the element that has the operation. Minimizing the number of public operations creates a
    more maintainable and understandable design.
</p>
<p>
    With respect to parameters, the return value, and a description of how it perform the behavior, operations can be
    detailed at a lower level that drives the actual implementation, or that detail might be left to be handled when
    writing the code.
</p>
<p>
    Data attributes can be identified based on information needed to support behavior or based on additional requirements,
    such as information to be presented to the user or transmitted to another system. Avoid indiscriminate domain analysis,
    because there might be a great deal of data in the domain that is not needed to support the requirements. Data
    attributes can simply be identified or they can be designed in detail, with attribute types, initial values, and
    constraints. Decide on the visibility of the data attribute; operations to access and update the data can be added or
    deferred until implementation.
</p>
<p>
    Generalization and interfaces can be applied to simplify or otherwise improve the design. Ensure that the use of these
    techniques actually improves the design, rather than bogging it down with complexity. For example, common behavior can
    be factored into a parent class through generalization or out to a helper class through delegation. The latter solution
    can be more understandable and maintainable, because generalization is an inflexible relationship (see the section that
    follows on inheritance).
</p>
<p>
    The refinement of any portion of the design could include another pass through the design process. You might find that
    what was initially identified as a single behavior of an element warrants a detailed walkthrough of the collaborating
    elements to realize that behavior.
</p>
<p>
    When updating an existing design -- especially one that has had portions already implemented -- apply refactoring to
    ensure that the improved design continues to perform as expected.
</p>
<h4>
    Organize elements
</h4>
<p>
    In a design of any notable size, the elements must be organized into packages. Assign the elements to existing or new
    packages, and ensure that the visibility relationships between the packages support the navigation required between the
    elements. Decide whether each element should be visible to elements outside of the package.
</p>
<p>
    When structuring the design into packages, consider <a class="elementLink"
    href="./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/guidelines/layering_F169CF07.html"
    guid="_0gpkAMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Layering</a> and other patterns. Although all design work must conform to existing
    architectural decisions, the allocation of elements to packages and possible updates to package visibility are of
    significant architectural concern. The developer should collaborate with the architect to ensure that package-level
    decisions are in accordance with the rest of the architecture.
</p>
<p>
    This guideline first talks about the identification and design of the elements and then about organizing the elements
    into packages. However, this is not a strict order of events. There is nothing wrong with identifying a package
    structure for the system and then populating that structure with identified elements, as long as the actual elements
    identified are allowed to influence the resulting package structure. See the sections on identification and behavior of
    elements in <a class="elementLinkWithType"
    href="./../../../practice.tech.evolutionary_design.base/guidances/guidelines/analyze_the_design_4C4750C0.html"
    guid="__MnggPTdEduDKIuqTXQ8SA">Guideline: Analyze the Design</a>.
</p>
<h4>
    Identify patterns
</h4>
<p>
    Identifying <a class="elementLink"
    href="./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/pattern_10BE6D96.html"
    guid="_0YJvUMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Pattern</a>s and seeking opportunities to leverage patterns are useful techniques. The
    value of patterns here is that they provide a shortcut to a robust design. For instance, when there's an interface
    realized by multiple classes, it's possible that an Abstract Factory pattern will be useful, because the pattern
    encapsulates the logic of what class should be instantiated. The more experienced a developer is, the better the
    developer is at identifying opportunities to take advantage of, or leverage, patterns.
</p>
<p>
    The longer you use patterns, the easier it will be to identify opportunities to leverage them. At first, look for
    places where you can clearly specify the need for some behavior. Perhaps there's a place where some function or
    algorithm must be shared between many different classes. How can this behavior be shared over and over among
    heterogeneous classes? Or perhaps a third-party library is replacing a block of custom code. Is there a way to make
    this transition easier by creating an interface that can use either implementation? These are opportunities for finding
    or possibly creating a pattern.

<h3>
    Inheriting behavior versus inheriting interfaces
</h3>
<p>
    Inheritance (or generalization) is often used as a shortcut during implementation to quickly re-use behavior (code).
</p>
<p>
    <b>Caution:</b><br />
    Work hard to remove behavior inheritance in design. It will almost always cost more effort than it saves.
</p>
<p>
    Inheritance is a very rigid structure with strict rules. A class that inherits from another class is establishing an
    <b>is-a</b> relationship. The inheriting class is a type of the parent class-- the child has the same relationships and
    behaviors as the parent. In most hierarchies, it will be impossible to maintain this type of relationship. Exceptions
    quickly creep in, and it's common to find child classes that remove or override behavior in the parent classes. This
    increases maintenance costs and makes it difficult to understand what each class does.
</p>
<p>
    It's also too tempting to instantiate parent classes, which makes the parent class both abstract and concrete. If a
    class has children, it must be abstract enough to support the generalized behavior of the children. But if it's
    instantiated, it must be concrete enough to provide specific behavior. It's rarely possible to fulfill both of these
    competing imperatives at the same time, and the design suffers.
</p>
<p>
    Use association and aggregation relationships instead of inheriting behavior. Patterns are a good tool to leverage in
    breaking up inheritance hierarchies.
</p>
<p>
    Inheriting interfaces is safe, because only the description and not the implementation of what needs to be done is
    reused.
</p>
<p>
    Avoiding inheriting behavior is an application of the Open-Closed Principle. See <a class="elementLinkWithType"
    href="./../../../practice.tech.evolutionary_design.base/guidances/concepts/design_E36137FA.html"

    <strong>Revisit the analysis</strong>
</h3>

    evolving a more robust design.<br />
</p>
<h4>
    <strong>Consider the architecture</strong>
</h4>
<p>
    The architecture must be considered in all design changes. The "best" design for a particular part of the solution may
    not be appropriate because of architectural constraints that must support the entire system. The architecture may also
    help to make design decisions, because it can be part of the selection criteria between two potential solutions.
    Developers should always be up-to-date with the architecture and review it often, particularly in early iterations.
</p>
<p>
    This guideline remarks on conforming to the architecture in various ways; it is written as though it is about designing
    within a pre-existing architecture. Although projects will often have pre-existing architectures available, a
    particular architecture is the result of design activities. Therefore, in addition to discussing conformance to some
    existing architecture, you must also consider the creation of the architecture, as well as updates and improvements
    based on the work of design.

    This task is about designing part of the system, not the whole system.&nbsp; It should be applied based upon some small
    subset of requirements.&nbsp; The requirements driving the design could be scenario-based functional requirements,
    non-functional requirements, or a combination.
</p>
<p>
    This task can be applied in some specific context such as the database access elements required for some
    scenario.&nbsp; In this case the task might be applied&nbsp;again later&nbsp;to deal with a different context on the
    same requirements.&nbsp; Keep in mind that to actually build some functionality of value&nbsp;to the users, all
    contexts will typically need to be designed and implemented. For example, to actually utilize some system capability it
    will have to have been designed and implemented all its context such as user interface, business rules, database
    access, etc.
</p>
<p>
    For cohesion and completeness, this task is described as an end-to-end pass of designing a scenario of system usage. In
    practice, this task will be revisited many times as the design is first considered, portions are implemented, more
    design is performed based on what was learned, etc. The healthiest application of this task is in very close proximity
    to the implementation.

    If this task is being performed on an architecturally significant element the results of this design should be
    referenced by the <a class="elementLink"

</p>]]></MainDescription>
          <KeyConsiderations><![CDATA[<p>
    Each step in this task can cause all previous steps to be revisited in light of new information and decisions.&nbsp;
    For example, while determining how elements collaborate&nbsp;you might find a gap in the requirements that causes you
    to go back to the beginning after collaborating with the analyst, or when evaluating the design a reviewer
    could&nbsp;note that a reusable element being used doesn't work as expected and that could cause you to identify new
    elements to take its place.
</p>
<p>
    Consider the architecture while performing this task.&nbsp; All design work must be done while regarding the
    architecture within which the design exists.&nbsp; Furthermore, certain design elements will be deemed architecturally
    significant; those elements will require updates to the architecture.
</p>
<p>
    This task will be applied numerous times.&nbsp; Design is best performed in small chunks.
</p>
<p>
    Even when starting the design for a particular project it&nbsp;is expected that there will be existing frameworks and
    reusable elements.&nbsp; Every step of this task must give attention to the existing design and existing
    implementation, utilizing existing elements when possible and emulating or improving existing elements as appropriate
    while designing this portion of the solution.
</p>
<p>
    Apply patterns throughout this task.&nbsp; Patterns represent proven designs and their usage promotes quality and
    consistency across the design.

    Consider the design from various angles to ensure that it is a high-quality, communicable design. Work with other&#xD;
    technical team members; an independent party can provide a fresh perspective. Use the tester and architect to provide&#xD;
    perspectives on design quality and adherence to the architecture. However, when identifying potential reviewers keep in&#xD;
    mind that if someone can add value by reviewing the design, then perhaps they could have added even more value by&#xD;
    actively participating in the design effort itself. If design flaws are identified, improve the design.&#xD;

    This template describes how the design can be organized to be understood from multiple perspectives. It also provides
    suggestions for how patterns and descriptions of small, reusable interactions can be used to minimize redundancy.
</p>
<p>
    It is important not to think of design as "a document." Design information that is worth keeping for some duration must
    have a long-lived form. But that form might be as a repository in a visual modeling tool, or as subdirectories of
    whiteboard diagrams captured with a digital camera, or as an actual document that provides structure for images taken
    from a myriad of sources.
</p>
<p>
    Designs are often organized into requirement realizations. A requirements realization is a part of the design that
    shows how one or more requirements is implemented.
</p>
<p>
    This template describes the information that should be conveyed. Typically, it works best to convey the information
    graphically (either with UML or another unambiguous notation), or at least in words, at an abstract level. You can
    enhance this with code examples, but best not to render the design solely at the code level.
</p>
<p>
    The structure of the design is suggested in this template.
</p>
<h2>
    Design structure
</h2>
<p style="COLOR: #0000ff">
    [Describe the design from the highest level. This is commonly done with a diagram that shows a layered architecture.]
</p>
<h2>
    Subsystems
</h2>
<h3>
    [Sub-system1]
</h3>
<p style="COLOR: #0000ff">
    [Describe the design of a portion of the system (a package or component, for instance). The design should capture both
    static and dynamic perspectives.
</p>
<p style="COLOR: #0000ff">
    When capturing dynamic descriptions of behavior, look for reusable chunks of behavior that you can reference to
    simplify the design of the requirement realizations.
</p>
<p style="COLOR: #0000ff">
    You can break this section down into lower-level subsections to describe lower-level, encapsulated subsystems.]
</p>
<h2>
    Patterns
</h2>
<h3>
    [Pattern1]
</h3>
<h4>
    Overview
</h4>
<p style="COLOR: #0000ff">
    [Provide an overview of the pattern in words in some consistent form. The overview of a pattern can include the intent,
    motivation, and applicability.]
</p>
<h4>
    Structure
</h4>
<p style="COLOR: #0000ff">
    [Describe the pattern from a static perspective. Include all of the participants and how they relate to one another,
    and call out the&nbsp;relevant data and behavior.]
</p>
<h4>
    Behavior
</h4>
<p style="COLOR: #0000ff">
    [Describe the pattern from a dynamic perspective. Walk the reader through how the participants collaborate to support
    various scenarios.]

<h3>
    [Realization1]
</h3>
<h4>
    View of participants
</h4>
<p style="COLOR: #0000ff">
    [Describe the participating design elements from a static perspective, giving details such as behavior, relationships,
    and attributes relevant to this realization.]
</p>
<h4>
    Basic scenario
</h4>
<p style="COLOR: #0000ff">
    [For the main flow, describe how instances of the design elements collaborate to realize the requirements. When using
    UML, this can be done with collaboration diagrams (sequence or communication).]
</p>
<h4>
    Additional scenarios
</h4>
<p style="COLOR: #0000ff">
    [For other scenarios that must be described to convey an appropriate amount of information about how the requirement
    behavior will be realized, describe how instances of the design elements collaborate to realize the requirement. When
    using UML, you can do this with collaboration diagrams (sequence or communication).]

    <strong>Getting Started</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Begin by gaining an understanding of&nbsp;<a class="elementLinkWithUserText"
    href="./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/pattern_10BE6D96.html"
    guid="_0YJvUMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">design patterns</a>. There are good references in the Additional&nbsp;Information
    section of the&nbsp;<a class="elementLink"
    href="./../../../practice.tech.evolutionary_design.base/guidances/practices/evolutionary_design_DE27D8D9.html"
    guid="_aSVhIB4qEd2bS8fFOQ7WWA">Evolutionary Design</a>&nbsp;page. Patterns are essential to creating, managing, and
    evolving designs. As the name implies, evolutionary design involves returning to the existing design over and over
    again to refine, change, and improve previous thinking. It can be performed at the beginning of a development cycle
    (before implementation), during a development cycle (while implementing code), after the cycle (when the developer
    tests have&nbsp;successfully executed), or any combination of these. The team should determine where in the development
    cycle the design will be performed. See <a class="elementLinkWithType"
    href="./../../../practice.tech.evolutionary_design.base/tasks/design_solution_A97CE9EA.html"
    guid="_0fshwMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Task: Design the Solution</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Understand <a class="elementLinkWithUserText"
    href="./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/refactoring_1B63BA3B.html"
    guid="_Poc7IPDzEdqYgerqi84oCA">refactoring</a> and the difference between code refactoring and design refactoring.
    There is no exact boundary separating the two, but there are some clear areas where the developer will wear the "design
    hat" when reworking the design into a better structure. These areas will usually involve identifying where design
    patterns can replace or enhance the existing design, or areas of the design where patterns can be identified and
    harvested for reuse.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Common pitfalls</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Evolutionary design emerges from refactoring existing design. This improves the design without changing the behavior of
    the system. Failing to perform developer or unit testing is a high risk activity, as you can not guarantee that:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The original design works correctly
    </li>
    <li>
        The refactored design works correctly
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Therefore, you must perform rigorous <a class="elementLinkWithUserText"
    href="./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/developer_testing_FEBDAED6.html"
    guid="_ADwlAJRtEdyrdaw_xGakyw">developer testing</a> in order to verify the robustness of the design. Otherwise, you
    may waste a lot of time refactoring something that does not work, or refactoring the correct behavior out of the
    system.

    It is important that the author of this work product be able to analyze key decisions about the structure and behavior&#xD;
    of the system and communicate them to other collaborators. It is also important that these decisions can be&#xD;
    communicated at various levels of abstraction and granularity. Some aspects of the design can be represented by source&#xD;
    code, possibly with some extra annotations. But more abstract representations of the design will be at a higher-level&#xD;
    than source code.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The more abstract representation could use various representation options. UML could be used either strictly or&#xD;
    informally; it is a preferred notation based on its rich semantics and broad usage in the industry. Other techniques&#xD;
    could be used to communicate the design. Or the design could use a mix of techniques as applicable.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Whether you record these representations on a white board or use a formal tool is not governed by this process. But any&#xD;
    representation, whether characterized as formal or informal, should unambiguously communicate the technical decisions&#xD;
    embodied by the design.&#xD;

          <Background>The application of evolutionary, iterative, and incremental development methods for software dates back to the 1950s.&#xD;
Evolutionary development is an alternative to a waterfall process. In the waterfall process, each past step or phase in the&#xD;
process was considered complete before moving on to the next. The waterfall implies it is not possible to re-enter previous&#xD;
phases to perform rework on any part of the project. The evolutionary design process realizes a solution by enhancing and&#xD;
changing its structure and capabilities incrementally. This practice fits well within the framework of an incremental,&#xD;
iterative or spiral development process, but can be used in any methodology.</Background>

    The Evolutionary Design practice reduces time-to-market for agile teams by incrementally formulating the design while&#xD;

    patterns to improve quality and maximizing reuse opportunities.&#xD;

    Requirements&nbsp;realizations represent how one or more requirements are fulfilled in the design. This can take
    various forms. It may include, for example, a textual description (a document), class diagrams of participating classes
    and subsystems, and interaction diagrams (communication and sequence diagrams) that illustrate the flow of interactions
    between class and subsystem instances.
</p>
<p>
    In a model, requirements realization is typically represented as a UML collaboration that groups the diagrams and other
    information (such as textual descriptions) that form part of the realization.&nbsp;&nbsp; If using use cases, the
    collaboration may be further stereotyped as a use-case realization.
</p>
<p>
    Note that there can be more than one realization of the same set of requirements.&nbsp; This is particularly important
    for larger projects, or families of systems where the same requirements may be designed differently in different
    products within the product family. Consider the case of a family of telephone switches which have many requirements in
    common, but which design and implement them differently according to product positioning, performance and price.

    The Evolutionary Design practice describes how to create a high quality design by evolving the design in small
    increments and refactoring often. It should be used in conjunction with other practices or process elements to deliver
    high quality software. This example illustrates one possible way of utilizing the ED practice in conjunction with other
    practices.

<p>
    This diagram describes an evolutionary approach to developing software by incrementally considering a small part of the
    system. A brief amount of time is spent considering the possible design, the code is implemented using a test-first
    approach, and&nbsp;the design is reviewed and refactored until high quality software is achieved. The new part of the
    system is then integrated with the rest of the system, and another small part of the system is selected for
    development.&nbsp;

          <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h3>
    Introduction
</h3>
<p>
    Using visual modeling techniques to design software can help break down complex problems into a series of smaller,
    easier to manage tasks. Sharing pictures rather than written documents or source code also helps the understanding and
    communication of difficult concepts. Adopting standard modeling notations such as the UML increases this capability by
    helping to make diagrams precise and unambiguous.
</p>
<p>
    The degree of formality used when producing and disseminating models should vary according to your needs. Small,
    collaborative teams modeling around whiteboards and capturing the results on a sheet of paper or with digital cameras
    can yield good results. This can also help the team focus on producing software with the help of models; rather than
    becoming sidetracked into over-engineering both the models and the solution. Modeling tools provide additional value to
    projects, especially for more complex systems. Their specifics of use are outside the scope of this guideline, however.
</p>
<p>
    This guideline does not describe a formal sequential progression through prescriptive design steps. Whether some or all
    of these techniques are needed, or how long is spent on them will vary depending on real-world issues such as the
    complexity of the requirements; the experience of the designer; and the way the team works.
</p>
<p>
    This guideline uses a simplified scenario (Login) to help keep the focus on understanding the techniques rather than
    the specific requirements. In the real-world, it is doubtful that much time would be spent modeling a simple problem.
    Here is the use case diagram, for reference;
</p>
<p>
    <img height="142" alt="User Login Use Case Model" src="practice.tech.evolutionary_design.base/guidances/guidelines/resources/user_login_ucm.jpg" width="472" />
</p>
<h3>
    Identify elements
</h3>
<p>
    Render the identified design elements as classes in a UML diagram.&nbsp; Apply appropriate stereotypes and optionally
    render the class using an icon specific to the stereotype to characterize the intent of the class in the design.&nbsp;
    Name and briefly describe the classes in a few sentences. Do not spend too much time working on associations, as these
    will be developed through working on collaborations in the next step.
</p>
<p>
    Classes can be drawn as a basic UML rectangle or with a specific symbol associated with a particular stereotype.
</p>
<p>
    The resulting class diagram should be conceptually similar to this one:
</p>
<p>
    <img height="228" alt="Identify Elements - Initial Class Model" src="practice.tech.evolutionary_design.base/guidances/guidelines/resources/identify_elements_bce.jpg"
    width="290" />
</p>
<p>
    For this example, the <a class="elementLink"
    href="./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/guidelines/entity_control_boundary_pattern_C4047897.html"
    guid="_uF-QYEAhEdq_UJTvM1DM2Q">Entity-Control-Boundary Pattern</a> has been used to derive two classes (LoginUI and
    LoginController). In addition, two design elements already identified in the architecture (SecuritySystemInterface and
    User) have also been incorporated.
</p>
<h3>
    Determine how elements collaborate to realize the scenario
</h3>
<p>
    When determining collaboration, two kinds of diagrams are useful.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        A dynamic object diagram, showing how the design elements collaborate to realize the requirements.
    </li>
    <li>
        A static class diagram, showing the classes involved in realizing the requirements.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Remember to also update any other impacted diagrams as appropriate, based on modifications or additions to the design.
</p>
<p>
    Create a number of dynamic object diagrams that walk through how a set of objects collaborate to perform the behavior
    of the scenarios.&nbsp; Even if just one scenario is being designed, this might take multiple diagrams to render it in
    smaller, understandable chunks or from multiple contexts.
</p>
<p>
    <img style="WIDTH: 776px; HEIGHT: 355px" height="355" alt="User Login Sequence Diagram"
    src="practice.tech.evolutionary_design.base/guidances/guidelines/resources/user_login_seq.jpg" width="776" />
</p>
<p>
    The above sequence diagram shows the user credentials being passed through to the security system for authentication.
    Steps in the use case scenario are transformed into messages between the participating objects. The messages in this
    example are not yet fully formed (there are no parameters or return values), so they are prefixed with "//" to show
    that more work is needed.&nbsp; A sequence diagram was used in this example, but a communication diagram could have
    been used.
</p>
<p>
    It&nbsp;can be&nbsp;useful to create one or more static class diagrams that show the classes in the design that support
    the realization.&nbsp; These class diagrams are often called View of Participating Classes diagrams, they provide a
    focused view on the overall design by only showing the classes, relationships, operations, and attributes relevant to
    the collaboration.
</p>
<p>
    <img height="469" alt="Login VOPC" src="practice.tech.evolutionary_design.base/guidances/guidelines/resources/login_vopc.jpg" width="448" />
</p>
<p>
    This diagram shows the operations and relationships that were identified by drawing the sequence diagram. The
    relationships in this example&nbsp;have not been refined yet, so they are just shown as simple associations. Remember
    to examine the diagram to verify that the design can support the behavior in the sequence diagram.
</p>
<p>
    Working at this level of detail in the model during the early stages of design can be helpful. It keeps the diagrams
    relatively simple and easy to understand. It makes them easier to draw in a workshop and easier to change during
    discussion. It is often easier to add the detail once there is agreement on the fundamentals.
</p>
<h3>
    Refine design decisions
</h3>
<p>
    Once the fundamentals of the design are relatively stable, you can begin to add detail to the design. Some of this can
    be performed in code or in the model. If modeling is chosen, then refine attributes, responsibilities and
    relationships.
</p>
<h4>
    Describe responsibilities
</h4>
<p>
    Class responsibilities are either actions to be performed by an object or knowledge maintained and provided to other
    objects. Each class will typically have several responsibilities; each responsibility will evolve into one or more
    operations during design.
</p>
<p>
    Responsibilities are derived from messages on interaction diagrams or from non-functional requirements that a class has
    to support. Document a responsibility by giving it a name, and optionally a brief description (what it does).
</p>
<p>
    These operations can be left as self-evident from their context, they can be given textual descriptions of the
    algorithm required to perform the behavior, or they could spawn off another whole pass of this technique where a set of
    classes that collaborate together to perform the internals of the operation are identified, etc.

    Describe attributes and associations
</h4>
<p>
    A class may have to store simple data information, like: string, integer, and the like. For such simple type of
    information, attributes are defined for classes. For a more complex or "behavioral" attribute, consider creating an
    extra class and establish an association to it.
</p>
<p>
    To perform their responsibilities, classes may depend on other classes to supply needed behavior. These other classes
    might be ones already identified in this design session, they might be existing classes pulled from the architecture,
    or the need for new classes might be conceived. Associations in a class diagram can be used to represent inter-class
    relationships.

</p>
<p>
    This diagram shows a number of refinements. The LoginUI class has been replaced by LoginForm. The User class has been
    renamed UserCredentials and is created by the LoginForm class rather than LoginController. It is then used as a
    parameter for subsequent messages rather than passing the individual attributes. The SecuritySystemInterface class has
    been refined into two elements, ISystemSecurity, which provides a simple façade for interaction with the rests of the
    design; and SecuritySystemProxy, which handles interaction with the external security system.
</p>
<h3>
    Design internals
</h3>
<p>
    The classes in the design are likely to need to be distributed amongst different packages and subsystems or components.
</p>
<p>
    <img height="304" alt="User Login - Design Packages" src="practice.tech.evolutionary_design.base/guidances/guidelines/resources/dv_packaging.jpg" width="571" />
</p>
<p>
    In this example, the LoginForm, LoginController and UserCredentials elements have been placed in a package called
    LocalSecurity. The SecuritySystemProxy is a part of a subsystem called SecuritySystemAdapter which realizes the
    ISecuritySystem interface. The SecuritySystemAdapter wraps the legacy SecuritySystem, expressed here as a component
    offering a validateUser interface.
</p>
<p>
    Each of these packaged elements can be distributed amongst the team for further development work.
</p>
<h3>
    Conclusion
</h3>
<p>
    This guideline walked through the techniques in a concrete manner started with a scenario of a use case through to
    distributing the classes identified into a set of packages. This example demonstrates a technique for designing
    visually, but it should be considered as just one conceptual pass of design.&nbsp; One could as easily apply this
    technique when defining the internals of how the SecuritySystemProxy class will collaborate with a set of classes to
    validate the credentials.
</p>
<p>
    When applying this guideline, work in small chunks and keep in mind the goal of delivering software to the users that
    provides value. To deliver high-quality software requires consideration of how the pieces will work together to deliver
    that value. But as soon as key decisions have been made and the decisions have been communicated to the appropriate
    team members, the team should move on to implementing the source code to verify the design and deliver the value.

    Does the visual model conform to project or organization specific modeling standards?&#xD;

    Avoid rushing into defining the solution. First, gain agreement on the definition of the problem by asking the&#xD;
    stakeholders what they see as the problem. Then search for root causes, or the &quot;problem behind the problem&quot;.&#xD;
    Use&amp;nbsp;appropriate requirements gathering techniques. Formulate the problem statement. The purpose of this is to help&#xD;
    you distinguish solutions and answers from problems and questions.&#xD;

    Use the most appropriate technique to help you on requirements gathering.&amp;nbsp;Each technique is applicable in a&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If you can meet stakeholders in person, then you can conduct an interview or a brainstorming session. This face-to-face&#xD;
    collaboration is extremely valuable and reduces the chances of the project team misunderstanding the needs of the&#xD;
    stakeholders.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Some requirements&amp;nbsp;might already be documented in other work products (such as in change requests or work&#xD;
    items).&amp;nbsp; This can often be used as a solid starting position from which a full set of requirements can be created.&#xD;

    The best way to read this practice is to first familiarize yourself with its overall structure: what it is in it and&#xD;
    how it is organized.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Review the template for the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;

    Establishing and maintaining a shared vision of the problem being solved (stakeholder needs) and the high-level&#xD;
    properties of the proposed product (product features)&amp;nbsp;reduces the risk associated with stakeholder and market&#xD;
    acceptance by aligning expectations.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Unfortunately, misunderstandings and miscommunication about the product strategy often lead the development team to&#xD;
    develop a system that fails to meet stakeholders' needs and vision.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is&amp;nbsp;essential that the development team and stakeholders&amp;nbsp;share the same expectations.&amp;nbsp;The&#xD;

    guid=&quot;_0WVxcMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw&quot;>Vision&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;identifies the stakeholders, provides a common understanding of&amp;nbsp;the&#xD;
    problem being addressed,&amp;nbsp;captures&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;high-level stakeholder&amp;nbsp;needs and project constraints, and&#xD;
    provides the background and context for requirements that will be detailed later. A shared vision serves as input for&#xD;
    communicating the fundamental &quot;what and why&quot; for the project, and provides a strategy against which all future&#xD;
    decisions must be validated.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Establishing and maintaining a shared vision is also essential for planning and monitoring the scope of the&#xD;
    development&amp;nbsp;effort.&amp;nbsp; The product Vision&amp;nbsp;establishes the long-term vision for the product,&amp;nbsp;a vision&#xD;
    that typically spans several releases, and provides the information required for&amp;nbsp;cost-benefit analysis and&#xD;
    prioritization of work.&#xD;

          <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h3>
    Getting started&nbsp;
</h3>
<p>
    Creating a shared vision involves understanding and agreeing on the fundamental "what" and "why" of the product under
    development. This ensures that stakeholders and the development team have a common understanding of the problem to be
    solved, and understand the stakeholders' needs.
</p>
<p>
    Begin by reviewing the reference material associated with this practice to better understand the intent of the
    practice. Review the template for the <a class="elementLink"
    href="./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/workproducts/vision_2E71B03C.html"
    guid="_0WVxcMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Vision</a> to understand the information that it captures. Tailor the template for the
    specific needs of the project. Review the <a class="elementLink"
    href="./../../../practice.tech.shared_vision.base/tasks/develop_technical_vision_9D36CF2F.html"
    guid="_0fOAoMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Develop Technical Vision</a> task to understand what needs to be performed to capture
    and communicate the vision. Review the guidelines on requirements gathering techniques and requirements reviews
    associated with the Develop Technical Vision task, and select the appropriate technique(s) for the project. Educate the
    development team and relevant stakeholders on the purpose of this practice, and get buy-in on the techniques that will
    be used to establish and maintain a shared vision.
</p>
<p>
    This practice is related to many other useful practices. For example:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Requirements practices: the vision is one of the outcomes of stakeholder requests elicitation. It is also the
        primary input for developing more fine-grained technical requirements. stakeholders and the development team use
        the vision to provide the context and high-level objectives for the detailed technical requirements.
    </li>
    <li>
        Architecture practices: the vision outlines the high-level objectives and constraints for the system that inform
        architectural design decisions.
    </li>
    <li>
        Project management practices: the vision defines the scope and constraints of the project that are the basis for
        work prioritization and initial estimates of effort. The value delivered by the team at each milestone must align
        with stakeholders' expectations, expressed by the project vision.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Common pitfalls
</h3>
<p>
    <b>Rushing into a solution before the problem is understood.</b> The result is typically a system that fails to solve
    stakeholder problems and satisfy stakeholder needs. Avoid design while capturing the vision. Focus on the "what" and
    "why" of the product, rather than detailing the solution. Detailed technical requirements will be developed later, in
    conjunction with architectural design and trade-off analysis.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Failure to gain agreement on the problem to be solved.</b> Make sure that you have identified all stakeholders,
    captured their needs and wishes, and obtained agreement on the problem to be solved and associated constraints. Missing
    a critical stakeholder can result in significant re-work later.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Failure to manage scope.</b> Rome was not built in a day (or in a single project). Make sure that you capture
    stakeholder needs and features, and prioritize them to deliver as much value as early as possible. If the estimated
    effort is too great to commit to for a single external release, divide and conquer. The product vision may span more
    than one release of the product, providing a roadmap for future work, as well as work planned for the current project.

          <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h3>
    Getting Started&nbsp;
</h3>
<p>
    If you have just installed the test driven development (TDD) practice, start by reviewing the <a
    class="elementLinkWithType"
    href="./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/developer_testing_FEBDAED6.html"
    guid="_ADwlAJRtEdyrdaw_xGakyw">Concept: Developer Testing</a>. These will introduce you to the basics of what you need
    to know about developer testing in the context of TDD. For more introductory information, read this <a
    href="http://www.agiledata.org/essays/tdd.html" target="_blank">Introduction to TDD</a>.
</p>
<p>
    If your organization has never done developer testing before, start your adoption by educating the members of the team.
    Use the resources below for educational and reference materials. Begin to track your performance immediately, because
    that will give you quick feedback on how rapidly the team is adopting TDD, even if it is a very low form of adoption at
    first.
</p>
<p>
    Tools are critical for creating and managing unit tests. Educate the team on using new tools, and discover which
    practices and features of the tools will work best in your environment.
</p>
<p>
    Specify modest, attainable goals when adopting TDD. For instance, instead of insisting that every code change must have
    a developer test starting now, it may be better to limit TDD practices to a single important implementation element.
    This will allow the team to come up to speed on tools and learn new development habits while minimizing the impact on
    the overall schedule. After the team has gained some comfort with the new way of doing things (usually a couple of
    weeks or a single iteration), your refined method for TDD can be applied to all new or changed code. Continue
    increasing the team's capabilities with TDD by introducing new tools, constraints, monitoring, or methods in modest,
    attainable increments. This also allows the team to experience success with new techniques, which usually leads to a
    team that embraces rather than resists change.
</p>
<p>
    Like all process changes, adopting TDD requires that team members change behaviors and develop new habits, such as
    writing code only when a test already exists to validate it. Developers will need the education provided by the links
    on this page, and the methods described in this practice, to develop these new behaviors. They will also need to have
    their new behaviors enforced by the team as a whole, and by management, until constantly writing tests while writing
    code is a habit. TDD is no different from other areas of process adoption. The managing body (bosses or the team) need
    to put as much effort into creating new behaviors as the individual developers do.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>TDD Adoption scenario</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Here is one possible scenario for adopting the TDD practice. You will want to add, change, or remove steps to design an
    adoption roadmap more suitable to your environment. Hiring a consultant experienced in TDD will also speed your
    adoption of the practice and help avoid common pitfalls.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Educate the team on TDD. Use the presentations and articles referenced in this practice as a starting place. It
        would also be helpful for developers to attend a class on developer testing and TDD.
    </li>
    <li>
        Have the team review the material in this practice.
    </li>
    <li>
        Extend this practice to reflect any important constraints or requirements in your organization. For instance,
        indicate any extra information that may need to be described when checking in system or test code, link to any
        materials that describe internal tools that your team is required to use, or create a guideline describing how each
        test must be documented or structured to conform to corporate standards.
    </li>
    <li>
        Identify and prepare to collect the information or metrics that will tell you how well you are adopting this
        practice. Make sure that the metrics are easy to collect. Highly accurate metrics that are difficult to collect are
        often abandoned, so provide no value. Coarser measurements that are easy to collect usually provide sufficient
        information, and it is more likely that they will continue to be collected.
    </li>
    <li>
        Identify the initial, modest goals for your TDD adoption, such as "An average of 2 tests per method for
        implementation element X". The goal is to be successful at some incremental amount of adoption, not to adopt
        everything in a single event. Make success a regular habit.
    </li>
    <li>
        Select a critical system implementation element to start applying TDD on. Begin using new TDD tools and techniques
        to develop and test the code.
    </li>
    <li>
        Select a time frame to evaluate the adoption of new TDD techniques. It should be long enough to allow new habits to
        start to develop, but short enough that changes can be made relatively quickly. This will generally be sometime
        between a couple of weeks and a couple of months.
    </li>
    <li>
        Begin to use TDD as described in the practice. Write tests before writing system code.
    </li>
    <li>
        Evaluate your TDD adoption based on the objectives and metrics that you defined.
    </li>
    <li>
        Make adjustments based on your evaluation. Eliminate tools or tool features that do not prove effective, and
        increase practices that are efficient and improve quality.
    </li>
    <li>
        Determine the next step in adoption. Early on, this will be to write tests for more and more implementation
        elements until TDD is performed on all software for the system. Often, you will be able to achieve this after just
        a few evaluation cycles.
    </li>
    <li>
        Continue to examine how your developer testing can be improved. Address problem areas in regular project review
        meetings. Monitor testing sites (such as the ones referenced on this page), and have individual team members read
        new articles and books about developer testing. They can report back to the group to generate insight and
        discussion about more improvements that can be incrementally applied to your TDD practice.
    </li>
    <li>
        Continue to extend or modify this practice to reflect how your team is performing TDD, and what the next increment
        of adoption should be for your team.
    </li>
</ol>
<h4>
    <br />
    Common pitfalls
</h4>
<p>
    TDD is a new way of thinking about testing. Failing to plan and manage how the team's behavior needs to change over
    time increases the chance of failing at TDD. Keep the team focused on TDD, and watch for the team falling back into old
    habits.
</p>
<p>
    Individuals may opt for expedience and skip "small" or "insignificant" tests in an effort to meet deadlines. TDD's
    payoff is later in the development cycle, when the team is working with a high-quality baseline rather than fixing a
    mountain of bugs that have piled up. No change is too small to be tested.
</p>
<p>
    Individuals may ignore implementation refactoring once the code runs successfully. Implementation refactoring keeps the
    code maintainable and reduces code decay, a phenomenon where the average number of errors created by a code fix
    increases over time. The team must refactor after the code runs successfully in order to maintain stable code that can
    be maintained and improved over the long term.

    Developer testing is different from other forms of testing in that it is based on the expected behavior of code units
    rather than being directly based on the system requirements.

<p>
    It is best to do this at a small scale, much smaller than the complete code base to be authored by a developer over the
    course of an iteration. This can be done for one operation, one field added to a user interface, one stored procedure,
    etc. As the code base is incrementally built, new tests will be authored and existing tests might be revisited to test
    additional behavior.

    Write the source code to make the implementation conform to the design and expected behavior. You should strive to&#xD;
    reuse and/or generate code wherever possible, but you will still need to do some programming. To do so, consider the&#xD;
    following:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Examine the technical requirements. Because some requirement information does not translate directly into your&#xD;
        design you should examine the requirement(s) to ensure that they are fully realized in the implementation.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Refactor your code to improve its design. Refactoring is a technique where you improve the quality of your code via&#xD;
        small, safe changes.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Tune the results of the existing implementation by improving performance, the user interface, security, and other&#xD;
        nonfunctional areas.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Add missing details, such as completing the logic of operations or adding supporting classes and data structures&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Handle boundary conditions.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Deal with unusual circumstances or error states.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Restrict behavior (preventing users or client code from executing illegal flows, scenarios, or combinations of&#xD;
        options).&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Add critical sections for multi-threaded or re-entrant code.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Though many different considerations are listed here, there is one clear way to know when the source code is done. The&#xD;

    Verify that the implementation is fit for its purpose. Examine the code for its suitability to perform its intended&#xD;
    function. This is a quality assurance step that you perform in addition to testing which is described in other tasks.&#xD;
    Consider these strategies:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Pair programming. By pairing to implement the code in the first place, you effectively evaluate the code as its&#xD;
        being written.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Read through the code for common mistakes. Consider keeping a checklist of common mistakes that you make, as a&#xD;
        reminder reference.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Use tools to check for implementation errors and inappropriate code. For example, use a static code rule checker or&#xD;
        set the compiler to the most detailed warning level.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Use tools that can visualize the code. Code visualization, such as the UML visualizations in the Eclipse IDE, help&#xD;
        developers identify issues such as excessive coupling or circular dependencies.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Perform informal, targeted code inspections. Ask colleagues to review small critical sections of code and code with&#xD;
        significant churn. Avoid reviewing large sections of code.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Use&amp;nbsp;a tester to ensure the implementation is testable and understandable to testing resources.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Improve the implementation based on the results of these evaluations.&#xD;

    Communicate the impact of unexpected changes to the design and requirements.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The issues and constraints that you uncover when you implement the system must be communicated to the team. The impact&#xD;
    of issues discovered during implementation must be incorporated into future decisions. If appropriate, use&amp;nbsp; the&#xD;
    change management process to reflect ambiguities that you identified and resolved in the implementation so they can be&#xD;
    tested and you can manage&amp;nbsp;stakeholder expectations appropriately. Similarly,&amp;nbsp;leverage the design process to&#xD;
    update the design to reflect new constraints and issues uncovered during implementation to be sure that the new&#xD;
    information is communicated to other developers.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Usually, there is no need for a change request if the required change is small and the same person is designing and&#xD;
    implementing the code element. That individual can make the design change directly. If the required change has a broad&#xD;
    impact, it may be necessary to communicate that change to the other team members through a change request.&#xD;

    Introduction
</h3>
<p>
    With Test Driven Development (TDD) you do detailed design in a just-in-time (JIT) manner via writing a single test
    before writing just enough production code to fulfill that test. When you have new functionality to add to your system,
    perform the following steps:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>Quickly add a developer test</strong>. You need just enough implementation code to fail.&nbsp; For example,
        a new method about to be added to a class could be created that just throws a fatal exception.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Run your tests</strong>. You will typically run the complete test suite, although for sake of speed you may
        decide to run only a subset. The goal is to ensure that the new test does in fact fail.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Update your production code</strong>. The goal is to add just enough functionality so that&nbsp;the code
        passes the new test.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Run your test suite again</strong>. If the tests fail you need to update your functional code and retest.
        Once the tests pass, start over.
    </li>
</ol><br />

<h4>
    Why TDD?
</h4>
<p>
    A significant advantage of TDD is that it enables you to take small steps when writing software, which is not only
    safer it is also far more productive than writing code in large steps. For example, assume you add some new functional
    code, compile, and test it. Chances are pretty good that your tests will be broken by defects that exist in the new
    code. It is much easier to find, and then fix, those defects if you've written five new lines of code than fifty lines.
    The implication is that the faster your compiler and regression test suite, the more attractive it is to proceed in
    smaller and smaller steps.
</p>
<p>
    There are other common testing strategies (listed here in order of effectiveness).
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>Write several tests first</strong>. This is a variant of TDD where you write more than one test before
        writing just enough production code to fulfill those tests. The advantage is that you don't need to build your
        system as often, potentially saving time. It has the disadvantage that you will write more production code at once,
        increasing the difficulty of finding the cause of new bugs.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Test after the fact</strong>. With this approach you write some production code then you write enough
        testing code to validate it. This has the advantage that you're at least still validating the code but has the
        disadvantage that you lose the design benefit inherent in writing the testing code first.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    An underlying assumption of TFD is that a unit-testing framework is available. Agile software developers often use the
    xUnit family of open source tools, such as <a href="http://www.junit.org/"><strong><u><font
    color="#0000ff">JUnit</font></u></strong></a> or <a href="http://www.vbunit.org/"><strong><u><font
    color="#0000ff">VBUnit</font></u></strong></a>, although commercial tools are also viable options.

    With collective code ownership, any member of the team can change any piece of code in the system at any time. There
    should not be a policy or norm that one person is responsible for one part of the code base so that others are not
    allowed to modify it.
</p>
<p>
    Fostering an environment where any developer might be expected to modify any piece of code to implement some
    functionality, fix a bug, or improve the solution leads to a more collaborative team experience. Developers will become
    familiar with more of the code and benefit from the experience of others. It drives a high-performance team and removes
    hurdles so that changes can be made by those who need them when they need them. No one person can become the gatekeeper
    or bottleneck for changes to some subsystem within the code base.
</p>
<p>
    Collective code ownership works best if there are coding standards to prevent one developer's style from being
    significantly different than another's (see <a class="elementLinkWithType"

    guid="_aGqAsJ01EdyQ3oTO93enUw">Concept: Coding Standard</a>). It is also critical that there are developer tests in
    place to ensure that work on a unit of code does not break it.

    Test driven development (TDD) is the practice of writing developer tests and implementation code concurrently and at a
    very fine level of granularity.
</p>
<p>
    In test driven design, the developer first writes a small test to validate a small change, runs the test to ensure that
    it fails (a sanity check), and then writes just enough implementation code to make that developer test run
    successfully. This cycle is short and it rarely goes beyond 10 minutes. In each cycle, the tests come first. Once a
    test is done, the developer goes on to the next test until there are no more tests to be written for the implementation
    of the work item currently under development.
</p>
<p>
    <img alt="file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Administrator/Desktop/tdd_flow.jpg" src="practice.tech.test_driven_development.base/guidances/practices/resources/tdd_flow.jpg" />
</p>
<p>
    The practice of test driven development changes how the developer thinks. Tests are not written as an afterthought.
    Instead, developer tests are written as part of the everyday, every minute way of building software.
</p>
<p>
    What are the advantages of test driven design?
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Assumptions in the design are analyzed before the implementation code is written. To write developer tests, an
        examination must be made of the behavior of each piece of code to be written. Correct and incorrect behaviors must
        be defined. In a way, writing the tests before the code can be considered a version of detailed design.
    </li>
    <li>
        Code units designed for testability up front are cleaner and more loosely coupled.
    </li>
    <li>
        Errors are found earlier. Errors or gaps in the requirements and design are identified before coding begins, when
        it could be tempting to move ahead based on assumptions.
    </li>
    <li>
        A clearer collaboration strategy between the developer and others that might be responsible for the requirements,
        architecture, and design is put in place. During the creation of the tests, there must be a meeting of the minds as
        to what has been specified. After that, the implementation can carry on with confidence that there is a shared
        vision of what the code should do.
    </li>
    <li>
        There are unambiguous criteria for completion of the code. When the tests conclude successfully, the code is
        working as specified. Non-functional quality dimensions can be dealt with separately, but there is a clear moment
        when the code behaves correctly.
    </li>
    <li>
        The technique drives the developer to work in smaller increments with faster quality feedback. At any time, the
        developer is just one test away from having error-free code.
    </li>
    <li>
        There is a separation of concerns and effort between getting code working and improving the quality of the code
        that already runs correctly. Separating out these two areas of concern provides focus and time management support
        to a developer. In one pass over the implementation, the developer makes it pass the tests as simply as possible,
        and then in a subsequent pass, looks for areas to improve.
    </li>

    If you are just getting started with TDD or developer testing in general, you will need to know why developer testing&#xD;
    is a good idea, and the basics of what makes good developer tests. A good starting place is this &lt;a&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Here are some useful links to expand your understanding of TDD. Make use of these as you learn to enact TDD. Some of&#xD;
    these links are also good resources for on-going support and information.&#xD;

        The &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_driven_development&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>TDD: Wikipedia&lt;/a> entry gives&#xD;
        an overview of TDD and links to other TDD resources.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.james-carr.org/?p=44&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>James Carr's TDD Anti-pattern Catalogue&lt;/a> lists some&#xD;
        things to avoid when adopting TDD.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.james-carr.org/?p=44&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>TDD Mailing List&lt;/a> is a discussion forum for TDD&#xD;
        questions and issues.&#xD;

    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.testdriven.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>Testdriven.com&lt;/a> is a developer testing site with a wealth&#xD;
        of information, news, and partner links about developer testing.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Read the TDD whitepaper &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.agiledata.org/essays/tdd.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>Introduction to TDD.&lt;/a>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Once you are familiar with the basics of TDD, select various tasks to view more detail about what needs to be done to&#xD;
    perform the task. If you will be creating a capability pattern or delivery process that includes TDD, see &lt;a&#xD;

          <Problem>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The test driven development practice reduces time to market by reducing the amount of time needed to integrate and&#xD;
    stabilize builds. It improves productivity by finding and fixing errors close to the time that they are introduced. And&#xD;
    it increases the overall quality of the software by guaranteeing that all new code has been tested, and all existing&#xD;

<p>
    Writing the tests after the code is a chore. The urge is to rush through it, to finish up and move on. Writing tests
    before the code makes testing part of a positive feedback loop. As you implement more code, you see more tests passing
    until finally all the tests pass and you're done. People who write tests first seem to be more successful, and it takes
    no more time. For more on putting tests first, see <a class="elementLinkWithType"

    The Test Driven Development practice describes how to use TDD to create a high quality version of the implementation.
    It should be used in conjunction with other practices or process elements to deliver high quality software. This
    example illustrates one possible way of utilizing the TDD practice in conjunction with other practices.
</p>
<p>
    This diagram describes an evolutionary approach to developing the software by considering just a small part of the
    system. A brief amount of time is spent considering the possible design, the code is implemented via the TDD practice,
    and&nbsp;the design is reviewed and refactored until high quality software is achieved. The new part of the system is
    then integrated with the rest of the system, and another small part of the system is selected for development.&nbsp;

            <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h3>
    Introduction
</h3>
<p>
    The key to successful iterative development is ensuring that the development team maximizes stakeholder value and
    minimizes risk early in the lifecycle, while minimizing re-work later.&nbsp; This imposes some constraints on how we
    develop the use-case model.
</p>
<p>
    At one extreme is the classical waterfall approach, which attempts to&nbsp;detail all of the requirements prior to
    design and implementation.&nbsp; This approach delays delivery of stakeholder value and risk reduction unnecessarily.
</p>
<p>
    At the other extreme is&nbsp;beginning development prior to understanding what the system must do.&nbsp; This approach
    results in significant, and costly, re-work later in the lifecycle.
</p>
<p>
    A better approach is to detail only those requirements which will be the focus of development in the next iteration (or
    two).&nbsp; Selection of these requirements is driven by value and risk, and thus requires as a minimum an abstract
    understanding of the "big-picture".
</p>
<p>
    The following discussion will outline the approach used to evolve the use-case model to achieve these goals.
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="How the Use-Case Model Evolves" name="How the Use-Case Model Evolves">How the Use-Case Model Evolves</a>
</h3>
<p>
    The recommended approach to evolving the use-case model takes a "breadth before depth" approach.&nbsp; In this
    approach, one identifies the actors and use cases and outlines them quickly.&nbsp; Based on this knowledge, one can
    then perform an initial assessment of risk and priorities and thus focus the effort of&nbsp;detailing&nbsp;the use
    cases on the right areas.
</p>
<h4>
    Inception
</h4>
<p>
    The purpose of inception is to understand the scope of the system.&nbsp; We need to understand the main purpose of the
    system, what is within the scope of the system, and what is external to the system.&nbsp; We must strive to list all
    the primary actors and use cases, however we don't have the luxury of being able to detail all of these requirements at
    this time.&nbsp; Strive to&nbsp;identify by name&nbsp;~80% of the primary actors and use cases and provide a brief
    description (one - three sentences) for each.
</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <h5>
        Identify stakeholders
    </h5>
    <p>
        Begin by listing all the external stakeholders for the system.&nbsp; These individuals will be the source of the
        requirements.
    </p>
    <h5>
        Identify Actors
    </h5>
    <p>
        Name and describe the primary actors.&nbsp; See <a class="elementLinkWithType"
        href="./../../../practice.tech.use_case_driven_dev.base/guidances/guidelines/identify_and_outline_actors_and_ucs_BB5516A9.html"
         guid="_eyL0wCu-EdqSxKAVa9kmvA">Guideline: Identify and Outline Actors and Use Cases</a>.
    </p>
    <h5>
        Identify Use Cases
    </h5>
    <p>
        For each actor, ask "what does this actor want to accomplish with the system"?&nbsp; This will reveal the primary
        use cases for the system.&nbsp; Name and describe each of these as you discover them.
    </p>
    <h5>
        Update the Use-Case Model
    </h5>
    <p>
        Update the use case model to capture the actor and use case names and brief description.&nbsp; Capture the
        relationship between the actors and use cases.
    </p>
    <h5>
        Outline the Basic Flows
    </h5>
    <p>
        For those use cases that are considered high priority by the stakeholders, or high risk by the development team,
        capture a step-by-step description of the Basic Flow.&nbsp; Don't worry about structuring the flow at this
        point.&nbsp; Focus on capturing the dialogue between the actor and the system and the key requirements for the
        system.
    </p>
    <h5>
        Identify Alternate Flows
    </h5>
    <p>
        As you work through the Basic Flows, ask: "What can go wrong?"; "What options are available at this point?";
        etc.&nbsp; These types of questions will reveal alternate flows.&nbsp; Capture these, giving each a name and brief
        description.&nbsp; Fight the urge to detail these alternate flows at this time.
    </p>
    <h5>
        Refactor the Use Case Model
    </h5>
    <p>
        Based on the Basic Flows you have identified, determine if there is common behavior that could be factored out into
        &lt;&lt;include&gt;&gt; use cases.&nbsp; Refactor the Use Case model accordingly.
    </p>
    <h5>
        Prioritize Use Cases
    </h5>
    <p>
        Given the abstract description you now have of the requirements, work with stakeholders to prioritize the use
        cases.&nbsp; This will be the primary input to iteration planning.
    </p>
</blockquote>
<h4>
    Elaboration
</h4>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <p>
        The purpose of elaboration is to demonstrate the feasibility of&nbsp;the solution prior to committing additional
        resources.&nbsp; To be successful, one must demonstrate that stakeholder value can be delivered and that the risk
        of continuing is acceptable.&nbsp; We must strive to detail and implement ~20% of the scenarios.&nbsp; These
        scenarios must be selected to achieve good coverage of the architecture (for example, a vertical slice through the
        architecture, touching as many&nbsp;components and interfaces as possible, is preferred to elaborating the GUI
        only).
    </p>
    <h5>
        Detail Basic Flow
    </h5>

        For those UC selected for the next iteration, spend the time to detail the basic flow now.&nbsp; See <a

        Detail Alternate Flow
    </h5>
    <p>
        For those alternate flows selected for the next iteration, spend the time to detail the flows now.
    </p>
    <h5>
        Update the Use-Case Model
    </h5>
    <p>
        Update the Use-Case Model to capture any refinements made as a result of your work.&nbsp; Depending upon the
        complexity of the system, you might want to introduce packages to group the use cases in a logical manner to
        simplify communications, iteration planning, and parallel development.
    </p>
</blockquote>
<h4>
    Construction
</h4>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <p>
        The purpose of construction is to incrementally deliver functionality (and value).&nbsp; Working from the iteration
        plan, continue detailing the remaining requirements.&nbsp; Shoot for completion of ~90 - ~95% of use cases by the
        end of construction.
    </p>
    <h5>
        Detail Basic Flows

    <p>
        Update the Use-Case Model to capture any refinements made as a result of your work.
    </p>
</blockquote>
<h4>
    Transition
</h4>
<p>
    The purpose of transition is to make the system operational in its intended environment.&nbsp; Some requirements will
    not be covered at this point.&nbsp; But the requirements must clearly not stress the design.&nbsp; The remaining ~5% to
    ~10% of use cases must be detailed and implemented in this phase.
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="Avoiding Functional Decomposition" name="Avoiding Functional Decomposition">Avoiding Functional
    Decomposition</a>
</h3>
<p>
    A common pitfall for those new to use-case models is to perform a&nbsp;functional decomposition of the system. This
    results in many small "use cases", that on their own do not deliver the "observable result of value" to the
    actor.&nbsp; To avoid this, watch for the following symptoms:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Small</strong> use cases, meaning that the description of the flow of events is only one or a few
        sentences.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Many</strong> use cases, meaning that the number of use cases is some multiple of a hundred, rather than a
        multiple of ten.
    </li>
    <li>
        Use-case names that are constructions such as "do this operation on this particular data" or "do this function with
        this particular data". For example, "Enter Personal Identification Number in an ATM machine" must not be modeled as
        a separate use case for the ATM machine, because no one would use the system to do just this. A use case is a
        complete flow of events that results in something of value to an actor.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    To avoid functional decomposition, make sure that the use-case model helps answer these kinds of questions:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        What is the context of the system?
    </li>
    <li>
        Why are you building this system?
    </li>
    <li>
        What does the user want the system to do?
    </li>
    <li>
        How&nbsp;do the users benefit from the system?
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    <a id="Structuring the Use-Case Model" name="Structuring the Use-Case Model">Structuring the Use-Case Model</a>
</h3>
<p>
    There are three main reasons for structuring the use-case model:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        To make the use cases easier to understand.
    </li>
    <li>
        To partition common behavior described within many use cases.
    </li>
    <li>
        To make the use-case model easier to maintain.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Structuring is not the first thing you do, however. There is no point in structuring the use cases until you know a bit
    more about their behavior than a one-sentence description. Establishing a step-by-step outline of the flow of events
    can assure your decisions are based on an accurate understanding of the behavior
</p>
<p>
    There are several advanced modeling concepts available in the literature for&nbsp;structuring the use-case model,
    however, following the principle of "keep-it-simple" only the most useful of these, namely the &lt;&lt;include&gt;&gt;
    relationship is discussed in this process.&nbsp; This relationship permits one to factor out common behavior into a
    separate use case that is "include" in other use cases.&nbsp; See <a class="elementLinkWithType"
    href="./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/use_case_model_CD178AF9.html"
    guid="_2jyfUAhVEduRe8TeoBmuGg">Concept: Use-Case Model</a>&nbsp;for more&nbsp;details.
</p>
<p>
    Another aspect of&nbsp;structuring the use-case model for easier understanding is grouping the use cases into packages.
    The use-case model can be organized as a hierarchy of use-case packages. For more information on use-case packages, see
    <a class="elementLinkWithType"
    href="./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/use_case_model_CD178AF9.html"
    guid="_2jyfUAhVEduRe8TeoBmuGg">Concept: Use-Case Model</a>.
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="Use Cases Are Always Related to Actors" name="Use Cases Are Always Related to Actors">Relationship Between Use
    Cases and Actors</a>
</h3>
<p>
    Running each use case includes communication with one or more actors. A use-case instance is always started by an actor
    asking the system to do something. This implies that every use case must have communicates-associations with actors.
    The reason for this rule is to enforce that the system provides only the functionality that users need and nothing
    else. Having use cases that no one requests is an indication that something is wrong in the use-case model or in the
    requirements.
</p>
<p>
    However, there are some exceptions to this rule:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        An&nbsp;"included" use case might not interact with an actor if the base use case does.
    </li>
    <li>
        A use case can be initiated according to a schedule (for example, once a week or once a day), which means that the
        system clock is the initiator. The system clock is internal to the system; therefore, the use case is not initiated
        by an actor but by an internal system event. If no other actor interaction occurs in the use case, it will not have
        any associations to actors. However, for clarity, you can use "time" as an actor to show how the use case is
        initiated in your use-case diagrams. <strong>CAUTION:</strong> if you have a lot of "time" actors in your model,
        challenge them.&nbsp; Perhaps you missed a real actor, such as an administrator responsible for scheduling reports,
        etc.

<p>
    You may choose to illustrate how a use case relates to actors and other use cases in a use-case diagram (in unusual
    cases, more than one diagram). This is useful if the use case is involved with many actors, or has relationships to
    many other use cases. A diagram of this kind is of "local" character, since it shows the use-case model from the
    perspective of one use case only and is not intended to explain any general facts about the whole use-case model. Refer

          <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h4>
    Most efficient way to write use cases
</h4>
<p>
    Because use cases model requirements, they are highly dynamic by nature. The more we examine a requirement, the more we
    learn, and the more things change. To further complicate the issue, changes to one use case can lead to changes in
    others. Therefore, we want a flexible, highly efficient method for writing use cases that eliminates unnecessary work
    and rewriting.
</p>
<p>
    An iterative, breadth-first approach, in which the use case is continuously evaluated before adding detail, is an
    effective way to write use cases. This breadth-first approach involves two aspects: writing the set of use cases and
    writing individual use cases.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Writing sets of use cases:</strong> Use cases exist in sets, and the relationships between the various use
    cases and Actors&nbsp;are important. As you learn more about the Actors, you also learn more about the system's
    boundaries and transactions. Likewise, as you learn more about the system's transactions, you learn more about its
    Actors. Therefore, it is more efficient to write several use cases simultaneously than to write them sequentially. This
    way, you can identify and understand the effects of the various use cases upon each other as you write them, rather
    than as afterthoughts that require rewriting or elimination of previous work.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Writing individual use cases.</strong> Similarly, it makes sense to write each individual use case iteratively.
    Starting with the main scenario, you can then identify various alternative and error flows that the use case might
    follow, then evaluate, rearrange or eliminate them, and then add the details of the surviving scenarios.
</p>
<p>
    Consider factors that can influence the format and level of detail for your use case description.
</p>
<h4>
    Detail the flow of events of the main scenario
</h4>
<p>
    As a starting point, use the step-by-step description of the use-case main scenario. Then, gradually add details to
    this scenario, describing <strong>what</strong> the use case does, <strong>not how</strong> to solve problems internal
    to the system.
</p>
<p>
    A flow of events description explores:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        How and when the use case starts
    </li>
    <li>
        When the use case interacts with the Actors, and what data they exchange
    </li>
    <li>
        When the use case uses data stored in the system or stores data in the system
    </li>
    <li>
        How and when the use case ends
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    It does not describe:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The GUI
    </li>
    <li>
        Technical details of hardware or software
    </li>
    <li>
        Design issues
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Identify alternate flows
</h4>
<p>
    A use case consists of a number of scenarios, each representing specific instances of the use case that correspond to
    specific inputs from the Actor or to specific conditions in the environment. Each scenario describes alternate ways
    that the system provides a behavior, or it can describe failure or exception cases.
</p>
<p>
    As you detail the main scenario, identify alternate flows by asking these questions:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Are there different options available, depending on input from the Actor? (for example, if the Actor enters an
        invalid PIN number while accessing an ATM)
    </li>
    <li>
        What business rules can come into play? (For instance, the Actor requests more money from the ATM than is available
        in her account)
    </li>
    <li>
        What could go wrong? (Such as no network connection available when required to perform a transaction)
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    It is best to develop these scenarios iteratively, as well. Begin by identifying them. Examine each possible scenario
    to determine whether it is relevant, that it can actually happen, and that it is distinct from other scenarios.
    Eliminate redundant or unnecessary scenarios, and then start elaborating on the more important ones.
</p>
<h4>
    Structure the use case
</h4>
<p>
    It is useful to structure the use case according to scenarios. This helps both to simplify communication and
    maintenance and to permit the use cases to be implemented iteratively.
</p>
<p>
    In addition to structuring the use cases according to scenarios, it is often useful to structure the scenarios
    themselves into sub-flows. This provides an additional level of granularity for planning work and tracking progress.
    Unless a sub-flow involves only a minor part of the complete flow of events (which can be described in the body of the
    text), it is recommended that you describe each sub-flow in a separate section to the Flow of Events section. Sub-flows
    that need to be in a separate section include these examples:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Sub-flows that occupy a large segment of a given flow of events.
    </li>
    <li>
        Exceptional and alternate flows of events. This helps the use case's basic flow of events to stand out more
        clearly.
    </li>
    <li>
        Any sub-flow that can be executed at several intervals in the same flow of events.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Describe special requirements
</h4>
<p>
    You must also capture any requirements that are related to the use case, but are not taken into consideration in the
    flow of events of the use case. Such requirements are likely to be nonfunctional.
</p>
<p>
    Typically, nonfunctional requirements that refer to a specific use case are captured in the special requirements
    section of the use case.&nbsp;If there are nonfunctional requirements that apply to more than one use case, capture
    these in the system-wide requirements specification.
</p>
<h4>
    Describe preconditions and postconditions
</h4>
<p>
    A <strong>precondition</strong> on a use case explains the state that the system must be in for the use case to be able
    to start. Be careful in describing the system state. Avoid describing the detail of other, incidental activities that
    might already have taken place.
</p>
<p>
    A <strong>postcondition</strong> on a use case lists possible states that the system can be in at the end of the use
    case execution. The system must be in one of those states. A postcondition also states actions that the system performs
    at the end of the use case, regardless of what occurred in the use case. Post-Conditions can be categorized as Minimal
    Guarantees&nbsp;or Success Guarantees.&nbsp; A Minimal Guarantee represents a condition that will be true when the use
    case ends, regardless of how it terminates.&nbsp; A Success Guarantee represents a condition that will be true when the
    use case ends successfully, regardless of which path it took.
</p>
<p>
    Neither preconditions nor postconditions need to be used to create a sequence of use cases. As a general rule, there
    must never be a case where you have to first perform one use case and then another to have a meaningful flow of events.
    If that is the case, correct the problem by reviewing the use cases.

          <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h4>
    Identifying actors
</h4>
<p>
    Find the external entities with which the system under development must interact. Candidates include groups of users
    who will require help from the system to perform their tasks and run the system's primary or secondary functions, as
    well as external hardware, software, and other systems.
</p>
<p>
    Define each candidate actor by naming it and writing a brief description. Includes the actor's area of responsibility
    and the goals that the actor will attempt to accomplish when using the system. Eliminate actor candidates who do not
    have any goals.
</p>
<p>
    These questions are useful in identifying actors:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Who will supply, use, or remove information from the system?
    </li>
    <li>
        Who will use the system?
    </li>
    <li>
        Who is interested in a certain feature or service provided by the system?
    </li>
    <li>
        Who will support and maintain the system?
    </li>
    <li>
        What are the system's external resources?
    </li>
    <li>
        What other systems will need to interact with the system under development?
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Review the list of stakeholders that you captured in the Vision statement. Not all stakeholders will be actors
    (meaning, they will not all interact directly with the system under development), but this list of stakeholders is
    useful for identifying candidates for actors.
</p>
<h4>
    Identifying&nbsp;use cases
</h4>
<p>
    The best way to find use cases is to consider what each actor requires of the system. For each actor, human or not,
    ask:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        What are the goals that the actor will attempt to accomplish with the system?
    </li>
    <li>
        What are the primary tasks that the actor wants the system to perform?
    </li>
    <li>
        Will the actor create, store, change, remove, or read data in the system?
    </li>
    <li>
        Will the actor need to inform the system about sudden external changes?
    </li>
    <li>
        Does the actor need to be informed about certain occurrences, such as unavailability of a network resource,&nbsp;in
        the system?
    </li>
    <li>
        Will the actor perform a system startup or shutdown?
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Understanding how&nbsp;the target&nbsp;organization works and how this information system might be incorporated into
    existing operations gives an idea of system's surroundings. That information can reveal other use case candidates.
</p>
<p>
    Give a unique name and brief description that clearly describes the goals for each use case. If the candidate use case
    does not have goals, ask yourself why it exists, and then either identify a goal or eliminate the use case.
</p>
<h4>
    Outlining Use Cases
</h4>
<p>
    Without going into details, write a first draft of the flow of events of the use cases identified as being of high
    priority. Initially, write a simple step-by-step description of the basic flow of the use case. The step-by-step
    description is a simple ordered list of interactions between the actor and the system. For example, the description of
    the basic flow of the Withdraw Cash use case of an automated teller machine (ATM) would be something like this:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        The&nbsp;customer inserts a bank card.
    </li>
    <li>
        The system validates the card and prompts the person to enter a personal identification number (PIN).
    </li>
    <li>
        The customer&nbsp;enters a PIN.
    </li>
    <li>
        The system validates the PIN and prompts the customer to select an action.
    </li>
    <li>
        The customer selects Withdraw Cash.
    </li>
    <li>
        The system prompts the customer to choose which account.
    </li>
    <li>
        The customer selects the checking account.
    </li>
    <li>
        The system prompts for an amount.
    </li>
    <li>
        The customer enters the amount to withdraw.
    </li>
    <li>
        The system validates the amount (assuming sufficient funds), and then issues cash and receipt.
    </li>
    <li>
        The customer takes the cash and receipt, and then retrieves the bank card.
    </li>
    <li>
        The use case ends.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    As you create this step-by-step description of the basic flow of events, you can discover alternative and exceptional
    flows. For example, what happens if the customer enters an invalid PIN? Record the name and a brief description of each
    alternate flow that you identified.
</p>
<h4>
    Representing relationships between actors and use cases
</h4>
<p>
    The relationship between actors and use cases&nbsp;can be captured, or documented.&nbsp; There are several ways to do
    this. If you are using a use-case model on the project, you can create use-case diagrams to show how&nbsp;actors and
    use cases&nbsp;relate to each other.&nbsp; Refer to&nbsp;<a
    href="./../../../practice.tech.use_case_driven_dev.base/guidances/guidelines/use_case_model_4C64E97D.html"
    guid="_0VAUsMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Guideline: Use-Case Model</a>&nbsp;for more information.
</p>
<p>
    If you are not using a use-case model for the project, make sure that each use case identifies the associated primary
    and secondary actors.

    There is a finite set of requirements to consider when it comes to gathering system-wide requirements, qualities, or
    constraints. Many of them are unfamiliar to stakeholders; therefore, they&nbsp;might find it difficult to answer

        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Usability
</h3>
<p>
    Usability requirements are critical to the success of any system. Unfortunately, usability requirements are often the
    most poorly specified requirements. Consider this common requirement: The system shall be easy to use. This doesn't
    help much, because it cannot be verified.
</p>
<p>
    While capturing usability requirements, it is a good idea to identify issues and concerns first, and then refine these
    into verifiable requirements later (see <a class="elementLinkWithType"
    href="./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/guidelines/writing_good_requirements_48248536.html"
    guid="_6jXzYNcKEdqz_d2XWoVt6Q">Guideline: Writing Requirements Statements</a>). According to a traditional definition,
    usability consists of five factors:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Ease of learning:</strong> A user with a specified level of experience must be able to learn how to use
            the system in a specified amount of time.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Task efficiency:</strong> A user must be able to complete a specified task in a specified time (or
            number of mouse clicks).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Ease of remembering:</strong> A user must be able to remember how to accomplish specified tasks after
            not using the system for a specified period of time.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Understandability:</strong> A user must be able to understand system prompts and messages and what the
            system does.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Subjective satisfaction:</strong> A specified percentage of the user community must express
            satisfaction with using the system.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    You might want to use the following method to identify and specify usability requirements:
</p>
<div style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2em">
    <ol>
        <li>
            Identify the key usability issues by looking at critical tasks, user profiles, system goals, and previous
            usability problems.
        </li>
        <li>
            Choose the appropriate style to express the requirements: 
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Performance style:</strong> Specify how fast users can learn various tasks and how fast they
                    can perform the tasks after training.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Defect style:</strong> Rather than measuring task times, identify usability defects and
                    specifies how frequently they can occur.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Guideline style:</strong> Specify the general appearance and response time of the user
                    interface by reference to an accepted and well-defined standard
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Write the actual requirements, including performance criteria (see <a class="elementLinkWithType"
            href="./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/guidelines/writing_good_requirements_48248536.html"
            guid="_6jXzYNcKEdqz_d2XWoVt6Q">Guideline: Writing Requirements Statements</a>&nbsp;for more information).
        </li>
    </ol>
</div>
<h3>
    Reliability
</h3>
<p>
    Reliability includes the system's ability to continue running under stress and adverse conditions. In the case of an
    application, reliability relates to the amount of time that the software is available and running as opposed to time
    unavailable. Specify reliability acceptance levels, as well as how they will be measured and evaluated. Describe
    reliability criteria in measurable terms. This is usually expressed as the allowable time between failures or the total
    allowable failure rate. Other important reliability considerations include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Accuracy:</strong> Specify requirements for the precision (resolution) and the accuracy (by some known
            standard) that is required in any calculation performed or in system output.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Availability:</strong> Specify requirements for the percentage of time the system is available for use,
            hours of use, maintenance access, and degraded-mode operations. Availability is typically specified in terms of
            the Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Recoverability:</strong> Specify requirements for recovery from failure. This is typically specified in
            terms of the Mean Time to Repair (MTTR).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Frequency and severity of failures:</strong> Specify the maximum defect rate (typically expressed as
            defects/KSLOC or defects/function-point) and severity of failures. Severity&nbsp;can be categorized in terms of
            <strong>minor</strong>, <strong>significant</strong>, and <strong>critical</strong> defects. The requirements
            must define each of these terms unambiguously. For example, a <strong>critical</strong> defect could be defined
            as one that results in loss of data or complete inability to use certain functionality of the system.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Performance
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Response times:</strong> Specify the amount of time available for the system to complete specified
            tasks and transactions (average, maximum). Use units of measurement. <em>Examples:</em>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Any interface between a user and the system shall have a maximum response time of 2 seconds.
            </li>
            <li>
                The product shall download the new status parameters within 5 minutes of a change.<br />
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Throughput:</strong> Specify the capacity of the system to support a given flow of information (for
        example, transactions per second).<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Capacity:</strong> Specify on the volumes that the product must be able to deal with and the numbers of
        data stored by the product. Make sure that the requirement description is quantified, and thus can be tested. Use
        unit of measurement such as: the number of customers or transactions the system can accommodate, resource usage
        (memory, disk, . . . ), or degradation modes (what is the acceptable mode of operation when the system has been
        degraded in some manner) <em>Examples:</em> 
        <ul>
            <li>
                The product shall cater for 300 simultaneous users within the period from 9:00 AM to 11 AM.
            </li>
            <li>
                Maximum loading at other periods will be 150.<br />
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Start-up:</strong> The time for the system to start up.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Shut-down:</strong> The time for the system to shut down.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Supportability
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Adaptability:</strong> Are there any special requirements regarding adaptation of the software
            (including upgrading)? List requirements for the ease with which the system is adapted to new environments.
        </p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Level of Support:</strong> What is the level of support that the product requires? This is often performed
        using a Help desk. If there are to be people who provide support for the product, is that support considered part
        of what you are providing to the customer? Are there any requirements for that support? You might also build
        support into the product itself, in which case this is the place to write those requirements. Consider the level of
        support that you anticipate providing and what forms it might take.<br />

    <li>
        <strong>Maintainability:</strong> Are there any special requirements regarding system maintenance? What are the
        requirements for the intended release cycle for the product and the form that the release will take? Quantify the
        time necessary to make specified changes to the product. There can also be special requirements for
        maintainability, such as&nbsp;a requirement that&nbsp;the product must be able to be maintained by its end-users or
        developers who are not your development team. This has an effect on the way that the product is developed, and
        there can be additional requirements for documentation or training. Describe the type of maintenance and the amount
        of effort required. <em>Examples:</em><br />
    </li>
    <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
        <ul>
            <li>
                A new weather station must be able to be added to the system overnight.

        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Scalability:</strong> What volumes of users and data will the system support? This specifies the expected
        increases in size that the product must be able to handle As businesses grow (or are expected to grow), the
        software products must increase their capacities to cope with the new volumes. This can be expressed as a profile
        over time.<br />

<h3>
    Interface Requirements (+)
</h3>
<p>
    Describe both the user interface and interfaces with external systems.
</p>
<h4>
    User interface
</h4>
<p>
    Describe requirements related to user interfaces that are to be implemented by the software. The intention of this
    section is to state the requirements, but not to describe the user interface itself, because interface design can
    overlap the requirements-gathering process. This is particularly true if you are using prototyping as part of your
    requirements gathering process. As you develop prototypes, it is important to capture the requirements that relate to
    the look and feel of the user interface. In other words, be sure that you understand your client's intentions for the
    product's look and feel. Record these as requirements, rather than merely using a prototype for approval.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Look and feel:</strong> A description of the aesthetic appearance and layout of the interface. Your
            client might have given you particular demands, such as style, colors, degree of interaction, and so on. This
            section captures the requirements for the interface, rather than the design for the interface. The motivation
            is to capture the expectations, the constraints, and the client's demands for the interface before designing
            it. <em>Examples:</em>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The product shall have the same layout as the district maps from the engineering department.
            </li>
            <li>
                The product shall use the company color.<br />
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Layout and navigation requirements:</strong> Specify requirements on major screen areas and how they must
        be grouped together.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Consistency:</strong> Consistency in the user interface enables users to predict what will happen. This
        section states requirements on the use of mechanisms to be employed in the user interface. This applies both within
        the system, and with other systems and can be applied at different levels: navigation controls, screen areas sizes
        and shapes, placements for entering / presenting data, terminology<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>User personalization and customization requirements:</strong> Requirements on content that must
        automatically displayed to users or available based on user attributes. Sometimes users allowed to customize the
        content displayed or to personalize displayed content.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Interfaces to external systems or devices
</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Software interfaces:</strong> Are there any external systems with which this system must interface? Are
            there any constraints on the nature of the interface between this system and any external system, such as the
            format of data passed between these systems? Do they use any particular protocol? Describe software interfaces
            with other components. These can be purchased components, components reused from another application, or
            components being developed for subsystems outside of the scope of the system under consideration, but with
            which this it must interact. For each system, consider both provided and required interfaces.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Hardware interfaces:</strong> Define any hardware interfaces that are to be supported by the software,
            including logical structure, physical addresses, expected behavior, and so on.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Communications interfaces:</strong> Describe any communications interfaces to other systems or devices,
            such as local area networks (LANs), remote serial devices, and so on.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Business Rules (+)
</h3>
<p>
    Besides technical requirements, also consider the particular business domain in which the system needs to fit.
</p>
<p>
    Business rules or policies that the system must conform to can constrain system functionality. Business rules are
    referred to by system use cases and can be in the form of decision tables, computation rules, decision trees,
    algorithms, and so forth. Describing the rules in the flows of the use cases usually clutters the use-case
    specifications. Therefore, they are normally captured in separate artifacts or as annexes related to the use-case
    specifications. In many cases, a business rule applies to more then one use case. Shared business rules must be stored
    in a single repository or&nbsp;document.

<h4>
    Level of detail necessary in use cases&nbsp;
</h4>
<p>
    There will often be use cases in your model that are so simple that they do not need a detailed description of the flow
    of events, a step-by-step outline is quite enough. The criteria for making this decision is that you don't see
    disagreement among user kind of readers on what the use case means, and that designers and testers are comfortable with
    the level of detail provided by the step-by-step format. Examples are use cases that describe simple entry or retrieval
    of some data from the system.
</p>
<h4>
    <a id="The Scope of a Use Case" name="The Scope of a Use Case">The Scope of a Use Case</a>
</h4>
<p>
    It is often hard to decide if a set of user-system interactions, or dialog, is one or several use cases. Consider the
    use of a recycling machine. The customer inserts deposit items, such as cans, bottles, and crates, into the recycling
    machine. When she has inserted all her deposit items, she presses a button, and a receipt is printed. She can then
    exchange this receipt for money.
</p>
<p>
    Is it one use case to insert a deposit item, and another use case to require the receipt? Or is it all one use case?
    There are two actions, but one without the other is of little value to the customer. Rather, it is the complete dialog
    with all the insertions, and getting the receipt, that is of value for the customer (and makes sense to her). Thus, the
    complete dialog, from inserting the first deposit item, to pressing the button and getting the receipt, is a complete
    case of use, a use case.
</p>
<p>
    Additionally, you want to keep the two actions together, to be able to review them at the same time, modify them
    together, test them together, write manuals for them and in general manage them as a unit. This becomes very obvious in
    larger systems.

          <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h3>
    Getting Started
</h3>
<p>
    After getting some basic familiarity with the concept of use cases, consider identifying use cases in a workshop
    environment, led by someone experienced in writing use cases. Detail one or a few example scenarios to serve as an
    example for other use case authors, to set a standard for format, style, and level of detail.
</p>
<p>
    Some teams prefer to identify all of the use cases and actors first, capturing those in a UML use-case diagram, or
    other sort of visual notation. Then they iteratively detail the use cases assigned to the current or next iteration, by
    outlining the steps in the use case main flow and alternative flows. When these steps and flows are detailed in the
    amount needed for development to start, it is useful to group flows in what is called use-case scenarios. Some teams
    prefer to identify scenarios first and then write the use cases in a more structured way later, by grouping related
    scenarios together. Scenarios can be used as a unit of work assignment and progress measurement on how use cases are
    analyzed, designed, implemented, and tested throughout the project.
</p>
<p>
    As you get more comfortable with this practice, consider supplementing your use cases with storyboards, activity
    diagrams, and additional requirements techniques. Modeling use cases in UML diagrams or in modeling tools can be
    helpful when there are lots of use cases, but start with a focus on the text and some key scenarios.
</p>
<h4>
    Common pitfalls
</h4>
<p>
    Try to avoid applying functional decomposition approach to use cases. That can lead you to find too many use cases, and
    use-case descriptions that are a half-page or less in length. On the other hand, finding too few use cases can result
    in overloaded use cases. It can lead to long and complex use-case descriptions. Try to find a balance that makes sense
    for your team, stakeholders, and the type of system that you are developing. There are different opinions about what is
    the appropriate number of use cases for a system. The suggestion is that even large, complex systems will have no more
    than a couple dozen use cases on average.

        <Presentation name="uc_realizations,_2uan8NbyEdqu5o2S60g5LA" briefDescription="" id="-CFYVionNDLkMw6SG6runQA" orderingGuide="" presentationName="" suppressed="false" authors="" changeDate="2009-03-28T06:38:35" changeDescription="" version="7.2.0" externalId="">
          <MainDescription><![CDATA[<p>
    A use-case realization represents how a use case will be implemented in terms of collaborating objects. This artifact
    can take various forms. It can include, for example, a textual description (a document), class diagrams of
    participating classes and subsystems, and interaction diagrams (communication and sequence diagrams) that illustrate
    the flow of interactions between class and subsystem instances.
</p>
<p>
    The reason for separating the use-case realization from its use case is that doing so allows the use cases to be
    managed separately from their realizations. This is particularly important for larger projects, or families of systems
    where the same use cases can be designed differently in different products within the product family. Consider the case
    of a family of telephone switches which have many use cases in common, but which design and implement them differently
    according to product positioning, performance and price.
</p>
<p>
    For larger projects, separating the use case and its realization allows changes to the design of the use case without
    affecting the baselined use case itself.
</p>
<p>
    In a model, a use-case realization is represented as a UML collaboration that groups the diagrams and other information
    (such as textual descriptions) that form part of the use-case realization.
</p>
<p>
    UML diagrams that&nbsp;support use-case realizations can be produced in an analysis context, a&nbsp;design context, or
    both, depending on the needs of the project. For each use case in the use-case model, there&nbsp;can be&nbsp;a use-case
    realization in the analysis/design model with a realization relationship to the use case. In UML this is shown as a
    dashed arrow, with an arrowhead like a generalization relationship, indicating that a realization is a kind of
    inheritance, as well as a dependency.<br />
</p>
<p align="center">
    <img alt="Use Case Realizations" src="practice.tech.use_case_driven_dev.base/guidances/guidelines/resources/ucrea1.gif" width="277" height="109" />
</p>
<p>
    A use-case realization in the&nbsp;design can be traced to a use case in the use-case model.
</p>
<h4>
    Class Diagrams Owned by a Use-Case Realization
</h4>
<p>
    For each use-case realization there can be one or more class diagrams depicting its participating classes. A class and
    its objects often participate in several use-case realizations. It is important&nbsp;while designing to coordinate all
    the requirements on a class and its objects that different use-case realizations can have. The figure below shows an
    analysis&nbsp;class diagram for the realization of the Receive Deposit Item use case. Note the use of
    boundary-control-entity stereotypes to represent analysis classes (see <a class="elementLinkWithType"
    href="./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/guidelines/entity_control_boundary_pattern_C4047897.html"
    guid="_uF-QYEAhEdq_UJTvM1DM2Q">Guideline: Entity-Control-Boundary Pattern</a>).

    height="213" />
</p>
<p align="center">
    <strong>The use case Receive Deposit Item and its analysis-level class diagram</strong>.
</p>
<h4>
    Communication and Sequence Diagrams Owned by a Use-Case Realization
</h4>
<p>
    For each use-case realization there&nbsp;can be&nbsp;one or more interaction diagrams depicting its participating
    objects and their interactions. There are two types of interaction diagrams: sequence diagrams and communication
    diagrams. They express similar information, but show it in different ways. Sequence diagrams show the explicit sequence
    of messages and are better when it is important to visualize the time ordering of messages, whereas communication
    diagrams show the communication links between objects and are better for understanding all of the effects on a given
    object and for algorithm design.
</p>
<p>
    Realizing use cases through interaction diagrams helps to keep the design simple and cohesive. Assigning
    responsibilities to classes on the basis of what the use-case scenario explicitly requires encourages the design to
    contain the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Only the functionality actually used in support of a use case scenario,
    </li>
    <li>
        Functionality that can be tested through an associated test case,
    </li>
    <li>
        Functionality that is more easily traceable to requirements and changes,
    </li>
    <li>
        Explicitly declared class dependencies that are easier to manage.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    These factors help improve the overall quality of the system.

    The best way to review a practice is to familiarize yourself with the enablement materials, and then review key&#xD;
    concepts, work products, tasks, and the more detailed guidance, either by reviewing the guidance category directly, or&#xD;
    by navigating from tasks and work products to their related guidance.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    You might first want to become familiar with general requirements concepts:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/requirements_8006414F.html&quot;&#xD;
        guid=&quot;_0Wh-sMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw&quot;>Requirements&lt;/a>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Then become familiar with use cases:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/use_case_BB199D1B.html&quot;&#xD;
        guid=&quot;_KudM0NcJEdqz_d2XWoVt6Q&quot;>Use Case&lt;/a>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/actor_411726C.html&quot;&#xD;
        guid=&quot;_zGqO0MDpEduTGJ8i4u8TMw&quot;>Actor&lt;/a>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
        href=&quot;./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/use_case_model_CD178AF9.html&quot;&#xD;
        guid=&quot;_2jyfUAhVEduRe8TeoBmuGg&quot;>Use-Case Model&lt;/a>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This practice focuses on the following work products:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/workproducts/use_case_22BE66E2.html&quot;&#xD;
        guid=&quot;_0VGbUMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw&quot;>Use Case&lt;/a>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
        href=&quot;./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/workproducts/system_wide_requirements_7D9DD47C.html&quot;&#xD;
        guid=&quot;_BVh9cL-CEdqb7N6KIeDL8Q&quot;>System-Wide Requirements&lt;/a>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Both work products go through similar states: they are identified and outlined, which allows them to be prioritized,&#xD;
    and then detailed. However, in general, a use case is detailed a scenario at a time. This is particularly important&#xD;
    when following an iterative approach, where a scenario is detailed &quot;just in time&quot; to be implemented, as opposed to the&#xD;
    approach of detailing all or most requirements up front.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Be also familiar with the tasks that drive the states above. In addition, guidelines and tool mentors associated with&#xD;
    each task provide details of how to perform the task.&amp;nbsp;Templates and checklists associated with the work products&#xD;
    guide you in their completion and evaluation.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Measurements can guide you on assessing how well you are following this practice.&#xD;

          <Problem>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Many organizations document requirements as a list of declarative statements (or &quot;shall&quot; statements) that lead the team&#xD;
    to focus on developing atomic functions and fine-grained assertions of need. Moreover, applications developed from such&#xD;
    requirements are often difficult to use and require more time for integration and testing than applications developed&#xD;
    using user-focused requirements.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A second, more serious organizational anti-pattern is no focus on requirements at all. Many organizations simply fail&#xD;
    to document requirements, leaving it to developers to discern from a perhaps vague vision document, or even nothing&#xD;
    more than a meeting or conversation, what the application or system to be developed must do.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This practice shows how to avoid these pitfalls by using use cases and scenarios to capture functional requirements.&#xD;
    That approach provides development scenarios that clearly express behavior (or the interaction between users and the&#xD;
    system under development). Use cases categorize valuable and useful end-to-end, testable and collaborative behavior in&#xD;
    which the system is involved. Non-functional requirements (such as performance, stability, usability, and so on) can&#xD;
    still be captured using traditional techniques. This practice also explains how use cases and scenarios are best&#xD;
    developed in conjunction with (and used to drive) other development activities, including design and&#xD;
    testing.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&#xD;

    Although listed as an <i>output from</i> and an <i>input to</i> tasks associated with the requirements discipline, this
    artifact can be updated at any time and by any role as new terms are identified. The terms defined should be used
    according to the recorded definitions in all project documentation so that all stakeholders can clearly see that terms
    are being used consistently.
</p>
<p>
    One of the primary decisions when developing&nbsp;this artifact&nbsp;is whether to have all terms in a single glossary
    or to maintain terms in several glossaries, business terms artifacts, or models.&nbsp;If terms are defined in multiple
    places, you need to communicate all of those sources to the team and decide which take precedence.
</p>
<p>
    It may be important, even in small projects, to reference and use existing broader glossaries, business terms
    artifacts, or data models, where they exist.
</p>
<p>
    Industry- and organization-wide glossaries may be referenced, and compliance with such specific chosen standards may be

    This activity is performed throughout the project lifecycle. The goal of this activity is to identify risks and issues
    early enough that they can be mitigated, to establish the goals for the iteration, and to support the development team
    in reaching these goals.
</p>
<p>
    The project manager and the team launch the iteration. The prioritization of work for a given iteration takes place.
    The project manager, stakeholders, and team members agree on what is supposed to be developed during that iteration.
</p>
<p>
    Team members sign up for the work items they will develop in that iteration. Each team member breaks down the work
    items into development tasks and estimates the effort. This provides a more accurate estimate of the amount of time
    that will be spent, and of what can be realistically achieved, in a given iteration.
</p>
<p>
    As the iteration runs, the team meets regularly to report status of work completed, the work to do next, and issues
    blocking the progress. In some projects, this status checking occurs in daily meetings, which allows for a more precise
    understanding of how the work in an iteration is progressing. As necessary, the team makes corrections to achieve what
    was planned. The overall idea is that risks and issues are identified and managed throughout the iteration, and
    everyone knows the project status in a timely manner.
</p>
<p>
    During iteration assessments, the key success criterion is the demonstration that planned functionality has been
    implemented. Lessons learned are captured in order to modify the project or improve the process. If the iteration end
    coincides with the phase end, make sure the objectives for that phase have been met (see <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../practice.mgmt.risk_value_lifecycle.base/guidances/concepts/phase_milestones_5678231E.html" guid="_HNxbwMBJEdqSgKaj2SZBmg">Concept: Phase Milestones</a> for more information).

    During project planning, iterations are identified, but the estimates have an acceptable uncertainty due to the lack of&#xD;
    detail at the project inception. This task is repeated for each iteration within a release. It allows the team to&#xD;

    Work with the team, and especially the project stakeholders, to identify the high-priority work items from the work&#xD;

    iteration plan from previous iteration should include an assessment of the results, and can also be used as input to&#xD;
    the current iteration planning. The team reviews its velocity and determines the amount of work that can be done within&#xD;
    the iteration. The team breaks down into tasks those work items that are assigned to the iteration, and estimates the&#xD;
    effort to complete each task. Typical tasks range from half a day to two days in length, and are captured in the work&#xD;
    items list. See &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

    Work items assigned to an iteration do not necessarily have the same priority. When selecting work items from the Work
    Items List, the iteration plan may end up having work items with different priorities (for example, you assign the
    remaining high priority work items, plus a few mid-priority ones from the Work Items List). Once work items have been
    assigned to the iteration, the team ensures that they can complete all work, regardless of original work item
    priorities. Deciding what to develop first on an iteration will vary across projects and iterations.
</p>]]></KeyConsiderations>
              <RefinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact captures the key milestones of an iteration, showing start and end dates, intermediate milestones,&#xD;
    synchronization points with other teams, demos, and so on. This artifact is also used to capture issues that need to be&#xD;
    solved during the iteration.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    You should list a few objectives for the iteration, which will help guide you throughout the iteration. Also, assess at&#xD;
    the end if those objectives have been achieved.&#xD;

              <RefinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact provides a focal point for the entire team:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It provides one list containing all requests for additional capabilities or enhancement for that application. Note&#xD;
        that some of these requests may never be implemented, or be implemented in later projects.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It provides one list of all the work to be prioritized, estimated, and assigned within the project. The risk list&#xD;
        is prioritized separately.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It provides one place to go to for the development team to understand what&amp;nbsp;micro-increments&amp;nbsp;need to be&#xD;
        delivered, get references to material required to carry out the work, and report progress made.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    These are the typical work items that go on this list:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Use cases (and references to use-case specifications)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        System-wide requirements&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Changes and enhancement requests&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Defects&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Development tasks&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Work items can be very large in scope, especially when capturing requests for enhancements, such as &quot;Support Financial&#xD;
    Planning&quot; for a personal finance application. To allow the application to be developed in micro-increments, work items&#xD;
    are analyzed and broken down into smaller work items so that they can be assigned to an iteration, such as a use-case&#xD;
    scenario for&amp;nbsp;&quot;Calculate Net Worth&quot;. Further breakdown may be required to identify suitable tasks to be assigned to&#xD;
    developers, such as &quot;Develop UI for Calculate Net Worth&quot;. This means that work items often have parent/child&#xD;
    relationships, where the lowest level is a specification and tracking device for micro-increments.&#xD;

    Many software-development tools support teams of people, with several users working with information stored in a shared
    repository. Each user uses the tool on their personal computer (client) and the shared repository is stored on a
    central server.&amp;nbsp;In this case the tool must be installed on the server and on the clients. Customizing the tool is
    done both on the server and on the client.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    There are tools that do not use a shared repository, such as compilers, debuggers, editors, graphic tools, etc. These
    tools can simply be installed on the users' computers. It may still be needed to customize the tools so that all
    members of the project use the tool in the same way.&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    The approach should be to automate as much as possible of the installation and customization procedures.

&lt;p>&#xD;
    Identify what other software is required for the specific tool to work, and install this software.&amp;nbsp;For example, a&#xD;
    tool may require a database management system (DBMS) be installed first.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    When you have installed the support software, you can install the tool on the server.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    Decide how to customize the tool so that it supports the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../core.mgmt.common.base/workproducts/project_defined_process_8BF5845B.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_2CEzsLrREd-0rKmWr1vEGQ&quot;>Project Defined Process&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;in the best way.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In addition to customizing the tools, you should set up user groups and access rights on the server.&amp;nbsp; In some&#xD;
    cases, a tool may provide its own mechanisms for this.&amp;nbsp; In other cases, user groups and access rights are defined&#xD;
    using the operating system.&amp;nbsp; The configuration of user groups and access rights affects how the tools can be used.&#xD;
    For example, you can set constraints on what parts of a repository certain users will have access to.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Document the customizations in project-specific guidelines.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p></Description>
              </Step>
              <Step name=" Integrate with Other Tools " briefDescription="" id="_ZUv109nnEdmO6L4XMImrsA" orderingGuide="" presentationName="" suppressed="false" sectionName="" variabilityType="na">
                <Description>&lt;a id=&quot;Integrate With Other Tools&quot; name=&quot;Integrate With Other Tools&quot;>&lt;/a> &#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Integrate the tool with other tools to make it easier to use. An integration between tools is in most cases in the form&#xD;
    of an extension to one or several tools. An 'integration extension' to a tool typically:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Synchronize data between the different tools. It automates the creation and maintenance of related items in&#xD;
        development projects&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Automatically adds traceability between related items in different tools.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Allow the user to add traceability between items in different tools.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Allow the user to navigate between tools. For example, access an item in a test tool from a requirements management&#xD;
        tool.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Allow the user to run certain functionality from one tool. For example, the possibility to create items in another&#xD;
        tool.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Allow the user to version a tool's items in a configuration management tool.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Most tools offer ready-to-use extensions to integrate tools with each other.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Describe how the tools are integrated with each other in the project-specific guidelines.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p></Description>

              <Step name=" Install and Customize Tools on Clients " briefDescription="" id="_ZUv11NnnEdmO6L4XMImrsA" orderingGuide="" presentationName="" suppressed="false" sectionName="" variabilityType="na">
                <Description>&lt;a id=&quot;Install Tools on Clients&quot; name=&quot;Install Tools on Clients&quot;>&lt;/a> &#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Install the tool on each client. The least that is needed to do when installing a tool on the client side, is to set up&#xD;
    the connection to the repository on the server.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Customize the tool on the clients, just as you customized the tool on the server:&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        In some cases you do not have to do anything with the client. For example, if the client is a web-interface it is&#xD;
        enough that the clients get the address to the application on the server. Some tools allow you to do all&#xD;
        customization on the server side. When the users access the repository on the server, they automatically get the&#xD;
        correct settings.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        In other cases you customize the tool on the client by installing software that customizes the tool, or installing&#xD;
        files with customization information.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It may be necessary to install 'integration software' on the client. Place the 'integration software' on a server and&#xD;
    allow the users to download and install it on their computers.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If it possible you should automate the tool installation, and the tool customization for the users. The benefit of&#xD;
    creating installation programs is that it allows you to set up the tools so that the clients get all the right&#xD;
    settings, extensions, and connections to the repository.&amp;nbsp; You create installation (and customization) programs,&#xD;
    and place them on a server. Then the users download these programs and run them to install and customize the tool in&#xD;
    their computer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br />&#xD;

    Unless the change is trivial, you need to educate the project members about the new Development Process, including any&#xD;
    guidelines, templates and/or tools. This can vary from an informal 2 hour presentation to more formal training,&#xD;
    depending on the size of the project and the project members' familiarity with similar development processes.&lt;br />&#xD;
    The following are commonly used ways to educate the project members:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Briefing&lt;br />&#xD;
        If the change is small or easy to understand a briefing to the team may be sufficient.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Mentors&lt;br />&#xD;
        Having experienced mentors or consultants on the project or available to the project is an effective way to provide&#xD;
        guidance on an as-needed basis.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Workshop&lt;br />&#xD;
        A one day process adoption workshop (PAW) for all project members can help &quot;kick-start&quot; a new or significantly&#xD;
        changed process. See Guidelines: Process Adoption Workshop&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Customized training courses.&lt;br />&#xD;
        If the project member have not attended the standard training courses in process and tools, an alternative is to&#xD;
        customize the standard training courses, to cover the project's development process, including guidelines,&#xD;
        templates and tools. However, it can be expensive to customize training courses. Generic process training, like an&#xD;
        introductory course to the Process or one or more practices, should be conducted prior to project startup, or in&#xD;
        the early days of the project. More specialized training in techniques, methods or technologies, is often conducted&#xD;
        &quot;just-in-time&quot;. This means that the training is given shortly before the method or technique is to be applied in&#xD;
        the project, to ensure that new knowledge is fresh in mind. &quot;Boot-camps&quot;.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        1-5 weeks of concentrated hands-on training. Not many organizations can afford to arrange these kinds of&#xD;
        boot-camps, but they have proven to be efficient if there are many new factors for the people in the project. A&#xD;
        boot-camp is typically a mixture of seminars, training courses and hands-on work with the process and tools.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

    Developing the team is part of executing the project. Improve the interactions and trust between team members,&#xD;
    incorporating team building into project activities, and empowering the team to make decisions. Management is done by&#xD;
    objectives and not by time reporting.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Help the team meet the iteration objectives by removing constraints, and by monitoring the progress and work remaining&#xD;
    to completion. When the team is falling behind, help the team assess how it can reduce work and still meet the&#xD;
    iteration goals. Involve stakeholders in approving changes and actions that affect them, so that their objectives for&#xD;
    the iteration can be met, and the issues they raise can be solved throughout the iteration.&#xD;

    Continuously monitor the iteration to ensure that it is progressing appropriately. Track the progress of the current&#xD;
    iteration by maintaining visibility on the status of the items that are being worked on during the iteration. In&#xD;
    particular, it is important to be able to understand how quickly the team is moving through the work scheduled for the&#xD;
    iteration, and how accurate the estimates were &lt;a class=&quot;elementlinkwithusertext&quot;&#xD;

    guid=&quot;_JlTPUM6aEdyuBO4ZIzcyig&quot;>[LEF07]&lt;/a>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Share information about the progress being made by having quick, frequent meetings with the entire project team. These&#xD;
    meetings are useful to understand what team members have accomplished since the last meeting, and what they plan to&#xD;
    accomplish before the next meeting. It also allows the team to identify any blocking issues. See &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../core.mgmt.slot.base/guidances/guidelines/collaboration_guidance_slot_D3B8DD40.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_68JUYN8-Edyhmsbt0Xyl8A&quot;>[Collaboration Guidance]&lt;/a> for more information.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Track the status of each work item by using visual indicators of state information (for example: defined, completed,&#xD;
    accepted) in a wall or automated tool. Since iterations are typically fixed in duration, another primary way to gauge&#xD;
    progress is to continuously monitor current status and also estimate how much work remains. Plot an iteration burndown&#xD;
    chart on a daily basis in order to visualize progress on a given iteration. This chart is plotted with the total&#xD;
    estimates for all the items that are not yet started and the estimated remaining effort for any item in progress. See&#xD;
    &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

    guid=&quot;_uAzgkDg3Edu4E8ZdmlYjtA&quot;>Report: Iteration Burndown&lt;/a> for more information.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Take corrective actions to adjust the course of the iteration if the burndown chart shows that the work will not be&#xD;
    finished as planned.&#xD;

            <Step name="Capture and communicate project status" briefDescription="" id="_urvQkGSyEd2DNqLAFatITA" orderingGuide="" presentationName="" suppressed="false" sectionName="" variabilityType="na">
              <Description>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Because outside stakeholders do not participate in the daily activities of the team, it is important that the status of&#xD;
    the project should be communicated to them as often as possible. This communication significantly lowers the risk of&#xD;
    disconnect between the development team and the stakeholders. The status provides the team with data they can use to&#xD;
    improve their development process.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Besides the iteration status, the overall project status can be captured and communicated in a burndown report for the&#xD;
    whole project. This report should show the progress toward the release date, and should be updated at the end of every&#xD;
    iteration (when metrics, such as the team's velocity, can also be provided). This allows the team to predict what it&#xD;
    can accomplish on the remaining project iterations. Other metrics (such as number of test cases passed) can also be&#xD;
    used to present iteration and project status.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Keep the status information visible to stakeholders and the project team at all times in a project workspace (walls or&#xD;
    automated tool), where stakeholders can come and experience first-hand the progress being made by the team.&#xD;

    Know about the team's problems and issues and&amp;nbsp;focus on problems that are blocking progress. A quick, daily meeting&#xD;

the iteration, while maximizing stakeholder value. Work with the team and stakeholders to revise the Iteration Plan and, as&#xD;
necessary, reduce the emphasis on less critical tasks by postponing them to a subsequent iteration. In rare cases, if the&#xD;
iteration objectives still seem impossible to meet, the team might consider terminating the iteration or reformulating the&#xD;
iteration to a new objective.</Description>

    Towards the end of the iteration, the team jointly assesses whether the objectives and evaluation criteria established&#xD;
    in the Iteration Plan were met, and whether the team adhered to the plan and completed all of the work items committed&#xD;
    to the iteration. The team makes use of objective measures to the greatest extent possible. To assess that a given work&#xD;
    item is completed, the team ensures that the corresponding test cases were successfully run against it.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The team prepares a demonstration of the features implemented at that point, so that during the iteration assessment&#xD;
    stakeholders can have a real sense of progress made. The team decides whether each developer should demonstrate the&#xD;
    features that they implemented, or if the project manager or senior developer demonstrates it all, with other team&#xD;
    members present to answer questions.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In addition to the demonstration,&amp;nbsp;prepare reports that show project status, such as work burndown and test case&#xD;
    reports.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;

    particular portions of the implementation.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    While architecture focuses on interfaces, patterns, and key decisions, the design fleshes out the technical details in&#xD;
    readiness for implementation, or as part of implementation.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This product can describe multiple static and dynamic views of the system for examination. Although various views may&#xD;
    focus on divergent, seemingly independent issues of how the system will be put together and work, they should fit&#xD;
    together without contradiction.&lt;br />&#xD;

            <MainDescription><![CDATA[<p>
    The architecture should be stable when the Construction phase starts, allowing the remaining requirements to be
    implemented on top of it. Another advantage of validating the architecture and eliminating as many risks as possible
    during Elaboration is that it provides more predictability in Construction, which allows the project manager to focus
    on team efficiency and cost reduction.
</p>
<p>
    Functionality is continuously implemented, tested, and integrated, resulting in builds that are more and more complete
    and stable. You may deploy a beta or prerelease to a sampling of the intended audience at the end of Construction.
    Delivery of the actual release is the main focus of the next phase.

    Because a Deployment Engineer is responsible for accepting the results of one or more development team members and deploying those&#xD;
    integrated releases into the production environment, it is important for all parties to agree on the details of a&#xD;
    particular release. The Deployment Plan documents, in one place, all the information that will be consumed by the&#xD;
    Deployment Engineer before and during the deployment to production of a particular release package.&#xD;

    The Deployment Plan should contain the unique instructions for deploying a particular version of a product. By &quot;unique&#xD;
    instructions&quot; we mean those things that are not part of a Deployment Engineer's normal procedures. Rather, they often&#xD;
    are specific procedures and timing constraints that a Deployment Engineer should be aware of as they are rolling out a&#xD;
    particular release.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    While&amp;nbsp;a draft version of the&amp;nbsp;Deployment Plan is typically developed by a development team, the Deployment&#xD;
    Engineer is responsible for its contents and existence.&amp;nbsp;A Deployment Plan&amp;nbsp;normally consists of the following&#xD;
    sections:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The scope of the release and a general overview of the capabilities to be deployed&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The timing and dependencies for deploying components to various nodes&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The risks or issues associated with the release based on a risk assessment&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The customer organization, stakeholders, and End User community that will be impacted by the release&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The person or persons who have the authority to approve the release as &quot;ready for production&quot;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The development team members responsible for delivering the release package to the Deployment Manager, along with&#xD;
        contact information&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The approach for transitioning the release package to the Deployment Engineer, including appropriate communications&#xD;
        protocols and escalation procedures&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The success criteria for this deployment; in other words, how will the Deployment Engineer know that the release is&#xD;
        successful so it can report success&#xD;

    While someone on the development team normally authors a draft version of the Backout Plan, the Deployment Engineer is&#xD;
    ultimately responsible for its contents and existence. A Backout Plan typically answers the following questions:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Under what circumstances will a rollback be required? Or conversely, under what circumstances will the deployment&#xD;
        be considered a success?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What is the time period within which a rollback can take place?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Which authorizing agent will make the decision to revert?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Who will perform the rollback and how soon after the decision has been made will the rollback be performed?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What procedures (manual and automated) will be followed to execute the rollback?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What other contingency measures or available workarounds should be considered?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What is the expected time required to perform a reversion?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What are the communication procedures required in the event of a backout?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Has the Backout Plan been successfully tested?&#xD;

    Sometimes, depending on the product user base, separate communiques might need to be prepared for each stakeholder&#xD;
    group. In that case, this artifact should specify the different groups to which communications are directed, the method&#xD;
    of communication (e.g., email, text or pager message, bulletin, newsletter, phone message, etc.). All communiques&#xD;
    should be prepared in advance so that it is a matter of disseminating information when the release to production has&#xD;
    been determined to be successful.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Also included in this artifact is a listing of the responsible parties who will execute the communications when a&#xD;
    successful release has been declared (normally the Deployment Engineer), as well as the timing and dependencies of the&#xD;
    communiques.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    While there is no prescribed format for the Release Communications artifact, each communique should indicate the&#xD;
    preferred delivery mechanisms (e.g., beeper notification, telephone calls, a posting to an internal release website,&#xD;
    live or pre-recorded presentations by senior management, etc.) and generally answer the following questions:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Who are the parties (Stakeholders) that are interested in knowing that a release to production has taken place?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What specifically (features, functions, components) has been placed into production?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Why is this release valuable to stakeholders and what business purpose does it serve?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Where is the product available (on which platforms, geographical locations, business units, etc.)?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        How can the stakeholders access the system and under what circumstances?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        When was the product released (or when will it be released if the release date is in the future)?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

                <RefinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Release consists of integrated, compiled code that runs cleanly, independently, and in its entirety. This is an&#xD;
    important rule because in order to be released or even &quot;potentially shippable,&quot; a Release increment must be able to&#xD;
    stand on its own, otherwise it is not shippable. Releases&amp;nbsp;can be created at either the program or team level.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There are three potential uses for a Release:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>It is not used outside of the program:&lt;/strong> It has been produced to minimize risks linked to technology&#xD;
        and a program's capability to integrate components and to produce a Build. This situation usually happens at the&#xD;
        beginning of a new product lifecycle.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>It is used by Beta Customers and the Program Manager:&lt;/strong> It allows End Users to test it in a Beta&#xD;
        test environment, which provides immediate feedback and reduces risks associated with user interface ergonomics.&#xD;
        Customer feedback will influence the Program Backlog for later consideration.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>It is deployed or shipped and used by End Users:&lt;/strong> This result provides immediate value to the End&#xD;
        Users.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In many organizations, a program Release typically is timeboxed to 2 to 3 months of development effort and 2 to 4 weeks&#xD;
    of hardening which results in a scheduled release approximately every 90 days. Releases for individual Development&#xD;
    Teams usually occur more often than those for programs, but there are no hard and fast rules regarding how often&#xD;
    releases should be scheduled. The only requirement is that working software should be delivered &quot;frequently&quot; by both&#xD;
    development teams and programs. Although the example timeframe described above is arbitrary, empirical evidence&#xD;
    suggests it is about right for most companies and fits nicely into quarterly planning cycles.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Each Release has a set of release objectives and a projected delivery date; it also has a planned number of Sprint/Iterations.&#xD;
    For example, a brief description of a release might be: &quot;The goal of Release 2 is to provide B2B scheduling capability&#xD;
    for the Ordering and Logistics Department. The Release is targeted for June 31 and will consist of five 2-week Feature&#xD;
    Development Sprint/Iterations and&amp;nbsp;one 2-week Release Sprint/Iteration.&quot;&#xD;

    Most activities during a typical iteration in Elaboration phase happen in parallel. Essentially, the main objectives
    for Elaboration are related to better understanding the requirements, creating and establishing a baseline of the
    architecture for the system, and mitigating top-priority risks.

    Because a Deployment Engineer is responsible for accepting the results of one or more development team members and deploying those&#xD;
    integrated releases into the production environment, it is important for all parties to agree on the details of a&#xD;
    particular release. The Deployment Plan documents, in one place, all the information that will be consumed by the&#xD;
    Deployment Engineer before and during the deployment to production of a particular release package.&#xD;

    The Deployment Plan should contain the unique instructions for deploying a particular version of a product. By &quot;unique&#xD;
    instructions&quot; we mean those things that are not part of a Deployment Engineer's normal procedures. Rather, they often&#xD;
    are specific procedures and timing constraints that a Deployment Engineer should be aware of as they are rolling out a&#xD;
    particular release.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    While&amp;nbsp;a draft version of the&amp;nbsp;Deployment Plan is typically developed by a development team, the Deployment&#xD;
    Engineer is responsible for its contents and existence.&amp;nbsp;A Deployment Plan&amp;nbsp;normally consists of the following&#xD;
    sections:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The scope of the release and a general overview of the capabilities to be deployed&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The timing and dependencies for deploying components to various nodes&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The risks or issues associated with the release based on a risk assessment&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The customer organization, stakeholders, and End User community that will be impacted by the release&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The person or persons who have the authority to approve the release as &quot;ready for production&quot;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The development team members responsible for delivering the release package to the Deployment Manager, along with&#xD;
        contact information&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The approach for transitioning the release package to the Deployment Engineer, including appropriate communications&#xD;
        protocols and escalation procedures&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

    The project starts with the assumption that you have:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Created the business case
    </li>
    <li>
        Identified the project manager
    </li>
    <li>
        Defined the team (at least for the first iteration)
    </li>
    <li>
        Put in place the development environment (including tools and infrastructure)
    </li>
    <li>
        Prepared your organization to follow the&nbsp;<a class="elementLink" href="./../../core.default.uma_concept.base/guidances/termdefinitions/delivery_process_BCDF50B7.html" guid="_ZufeMCO3EdqaNq6Ptg8uyA">delivery process</a>&nbsp;suggested by the published process description

            <MainDescription><![CDATA[<p>
    This activity describes the tasks you perform to gather, specify, analyze, and validate a subset of system's
    requirements prior to implementation and verification. This does not imply that all requirements are detailed prior to
    commencing implementation. Rather, you perform this activity throughout the lifecycle with stakeholders and the entire
    development team collaborating to ensure that a clear, consistent, correct, verifiable, and feasible set of
    requirements is available, as needed, to drive implementation and verification.
</p>
<p>
    During <b>Inception</b>, the focus is on gaining agreement on the problem to be solved, gathering stakeholder needs,
    and capturing high-level system features.
</p>
<p>
    During <b>Elaboration</b>, the focus shifts to defining the solution. This consists of finding those requirements that
    have the most value to stakeholders, that are particularly challenging or risky, or that are architecturally
    significant. You then describe requirements (that are prioritized, via the work items list, for implementation in the
    early iterations) in sufficient detail to validate the development team's understanding of the requirements, to ensure
    concurrence with stakeholders, and to permit software development to begin. For each of these requirements, define
    associated test cases to ensure that the requirements are verifiable, and to provide the guidance needed for
    verification and validation.
</p>
<p>
    During Construction, the focus shifts to refining the system definition. This consists of detailing the remaining
    requirements and associated test cases as necessary to drive implementation and verification, and managing requirements
    change.

              <KeyConsiderations><![CDATA[<ul>
    <li>
        When you document system-wide requirements, ensure that the needs of all of the stakeholders are represented. In
        particular, include the needs of those who are responsible for maintaining or supporting the system after it is
        delivered.
    </li>
    <li>
        Typically, there are some overlaps and gray areas between system-wide requirements and other requirements work
        products. For example, the authorization behavior of a system can be specified as use cases or as statements within
        system-wide requirements. The overall driving need is that no important requirements are missed or duplicated, and
        that there is an agreed upon approach for capturing and processing every type of requirement.
    </li>
    <li>
        System-wide requirements originate from many places. Documenting the source of the requirement is particularly
        important when you separate externally mandated requirements.
    </li>
    <li>
        Requirements are often thought of as "Qualitative" (specifying a quality or desirable characteristic) versus
        "Quantitative" (specifying a quantity). Qualitative requirements can sometimes be elaborated into quantitative
        requirements.
    </li>
    <li>
        A good quality requirement is one that you can verify, either through testing or some other objective evaluation.
    </li>
    <li>
        You must evaluate system-wide requirements for cost, schedule impact, and level of contribution to business goals.
        Based on your evaluation, the system-wide requirements should be iteratively challenged, defended, and amended.

              <KeyConsiderations><![CDATA[<p>
    Although listed as an <i>output from</i> and an <i>input to</i> tasks associated with the requirements discipline, this
    artifact can be updated at any time and by any role as new terms are identified. The terms defined should be used
    according to the recorded definitions in all project documentation so that all stakeholders can clearly see that terms
    are being used consistently.
</p>
<p>
    One of the primary decisions when developing&nbsp;this artifact&nbsp;is whether to have all terms in a single glossary
    or to maintain terms in several glossaries, business terms artifacts, or models.&nbsp;If terms are defined in multiple
    places, you need to communicate all of those sources to the team and decide which take precedence.
</p>
<p>
    It may be important, even in small projects, to reference and use existing broader glossaries, business terms
    artifacts, or data models, where they exist.
</p>
<p>
    Industry- and organization-wide glossaries may be referenced, and compliance with such specific chosen standards may be
    required.
</p>]]></KeyConsiderations>
              <RefinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact&amp;nbsp;helps you avoid miscommunication by providing two essential resources:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A central location to look for terms and abbreviations that are new to development team members&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Definitions of terms that are used in specific ways within the domain&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Definitions for the glossary terms come from several sources, such as requirements documents, specifications, and&#xD;
    discussions with stakeholders and domain experts.&#xD;

    A test case specifies the conditions that must be validated to enable an assessment of aspects of the system under&#xD;
    test. A test case is more formal than a test idea; typically, a test case takes the form of a specification. In less&#xD;
    formal environments, you can create test cases by identifying a unique ID, name, associated test data, and expected&#xD;
    results.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Test cases can be derived from many sources, and typically include a subset of the requirements (such as use cases,&#xD;
    performance characteristics, and reliability concerns) and other types of quality attributes. For more information on&#xD;
    types of tests and their relationships to quality test attributes, see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

    The goal of this activity is to define a technical approach to the system that supports the project requirements,
    within the constraints placed on the system and the development team. The architect should do the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Work with the team to create an initial sketch of the technical approach to the proposed system
    </li>
    <li>
        Ensure that the technical decisions are adequately captured and communicated
    </li>
    <li>
        Ensure that the team has enough information to understand the approach that your are taking
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The work done here does not seek to produce a detailed and comprehensive technical specification for the system.
    Rather, the approach should be to decide the overall technical approach at a high level.
</p>
<p>
    You should focus on proving the architecture with working software. If the solution is similar to a previously produced
    solution (or is a well-known solution domain), then it will probably be good enough to reference that example as
    evidence of the feasibility of the approach. In some cases, it may be necessary to develop one or more prototypes to
    validate some of the decisions or clarify some of the requirements.
</p>
<p>
    The conclusion of this work should produce just enough information to communicate the architecture to the team, and to
    demonstrate its viability to the customer. This allows the project to move forward, enabling you to refine and baseline
    the architecture.

    It provides a place for maintaining the list of architectural issues, along with the associated architectural&#xD;
    decisions, designs, patterns, code documented (or pointed to), and so forth -- all at appropriate levels to make it&#xD;
    easy to understand what architectural decisions have been made and remain to be made.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is helpful for architects to use this artifact to collaborate with other team members in developing the architecture&#xD;
    and to help team members understand the motivation behind architectural decisions so that those decisions can be&#xD;
    robustly implemented. For example, the architect may put constraints on how data is packaged and communicated between&#xD;
    different parts of the system. This may appear to be a burden, but the justification in the Architecture Notebook can&#xD;
    explain that there is a significant performance bottleneck when communicating with a legacy system. The rest of the&#xD;
    system must adapt to this bottleneck by following a specific data packaging scheme.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact should also inform the team members how the system is partitioned or organized so that the team can adapt&#xD;
    to the needs of the system. It also gives a first glimpse of the system and its technical motivations to whoever must&#xD;
    maintain and change the architecture later.&lt;br />&#xD;

    It is critical that this task be performed collaboratively with active involvement of other team members and project
    stakeholders so that consensus and common understanding is reached. It is particularly vital to involve the
    developer(s) throughout this task. The architecture effort&nbsp;is about providing leadership and coordination of the
    technical work rather than putting in a solo performance.
</p>]]></KeyConsiderations>
              <RefinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This task focuses on envisioning the initial architecture and outlining the&amp;nbsp;architectural decisions that will&#xD;
    guide development and testing. It relies on gathering experience gained in similar systems or problem domains to&#xD;
    constrain and focus the architecture so that effort is not wasted in re-inventing architecture.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The results are captured for future reference and are communicated across the team. It is important that the team has&#xD;
    enough information to understand the technical approach being taken.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The architecture evolves organically over time by outlining and refining portions of it. A few people get together in a&#xD;
    room and sketch out what they think the architecture will be. This envisioning effort sets the foundation for&#xD;
    prototyping. If the solution is similar to a previously produced solution (or is a well-known solution domain), then it&#xD;
    will probably be good enough to reference that example as evidence of the feasibility of the approach. In some cases,&#xD;
    it may be necessary to develop one or more prototypes to validate some of the decisions or clarify some of the&#xD;
    requirements.&#xD;

    Decide how to partition the software, both in logical and physical terms. Partitioning your system helps you manage its&#xD;
    complexity by using the well-known &quot;divide and conquer&quot; strategy. By breaking the process into smaller and more&#xD;
    manageable pieces, you make development easier.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As a minimum, decide on:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        How to partition the software when managing development (the use of layering as a partitioning strategy, for&#xD;
        example).&amp;nbsp; For more information, see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

        Its relationships to other partitions.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    At this point, you do not need to identify the elements that should be placed in each of these partitions.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;

    This artifact provides a focal point for the entire team:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It provides one list containing all requests for additional capabilities or enhancement for that application. Note&#xD;
        that some of these requests may never be implemented, or be implemented in later projects.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It provides one list of all the work to be prioritized, estimated, and assigned within the project. The risk list&#xD;
        is prioritized separately.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It provides one place to go to for the development team to understand what&amp;nbsp;micro-increments&amp;nbsp;need to be&#xD;
        delivered, get references to material required to carry out the work, and report progress made.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    These are the typical work items that go on this list:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Use cases (and references to use-case specifications)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

        Development tasks&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Work items can be very large in scope, especially when capturing requests for enhancements, such as &quot;Support Financial&#xD;
    Planning&quot; for a personal finance application. To allow the application to be developed in micro-increments, work items&#xD;
    are analyzed and broken down into smaller work items so that they can be assigned to an iteration, such as a use-case&#xD;
    scenario for&amp;nbsp;&quot;Calculate Net Worth&quot;. Further breakdown may be required to identify suitable tasks to be assigned to&#xD;
    developers, such as &quot;Develop UI for Calculate Net Worth&quot;. This means that work items often have parent/child&#xD;
    relationships, where the lowest level is a specification and tracking device for micro-increments.&#xD;

        Refine the initial sketch of the architecture into concrete design elements

        Ensure that the team has enough information to enable software to be developed

    <li>
        Ensure that the requirements that were prioritized for the current iteration are adequately addressed in the
        software
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    In an iterative project, the team should not attempt to develop the architecture for the entire project in a single

    It provides a place for maintaining the list of architectural issues, along with the associated architectural&#xD;
    decisions, designs, patterns, code documented (or pointed to), and so forth -- all at appropriate levels to make it&#xD;
    easy to understand what architectural decisions have been made and remain to be made.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is helpful for architects to use this artifact to collaborate with other team members in developing the architecture&#xD;
    and to help team members understand the motivation behind architectural decisions so that those decisions can be&#xD;
    robustly implemented. For example, the architect may put constraints on how data is packaged and communicated between&#xD;
    different parts of the system. This may appear to be a burden, but the justification in the Architecture Notebook can&#xD;
    explain that there is a significant performance bottleneck when communicating with a legacy system. The rest of the&#xD;
    system must adapt to this bottleneck by following a specific data packaging scheme.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact should also inform the team members how the system is partitioned or organized so that the team can adapt&#xD;
    to the needs of the system. It also gives a first glimpse of the system and its technical motivations to whoever must&#xD;
    maintain and change the architecture later.&lt;br />&#xD;

    It is important to continue to reduce the complexity of the&nbsp;solution by raising the levels of abstraction.&nbsp;

</p>
<p>
    Continue the collaboration with the whole&nbsp;team on the refining of the architecture in order to promote consensus
    and a common understanding of the overall solution. The architect should be working to coordinate and guide the
    technical activities of the team rather than doing all the work alone.&nbsp;Place special emphasis&nbsp;on
    involving&nbsp;the developer(s) throughout this task since it's the developed solution that will prove out the
    architecture and may result in refinements to the architecture documentation.
</p>
<p>
    Ensure that those who need to act upon the architectural work&nbsp;understand&nbsp;it and are able to work with
    it.&nbsp;Make sure that the description of the architecture clearly conveys not only the solution but also the
    motivation and objectives related to the&nbsp;decisions that have been made in shaping the architecture. This will make
    it easier for others to understand the architecture and to adapt it over time.
</p>
<p>
    You can communicate your decisions as many ways as you wish.&nbsp; For example:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Publication of&nbsp;reference source code
    </li>
    <li>
        Publication of&nbsp;reference models
    </li>
    <li>
        Publication of&nbsp;software architecture documentation
    </li>
    <li>
        Formal&nbsp;presentations of the material
    </li>
    <li>
        Informal walkthroughs of the architecture
    </li>
</ul>]]></KeyConsiderations>
              <RefinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This task&amp;nbsp;builds upon the outlined architecture and makes concrete and unambiguous architectural decisions to&#xD;
    support development.&amp;nbsp; It takes into&amp;nbsp;account any design and implementation work products that have been&#xD;
    developed so far.&amp;nbsp; In other words, the architecture evolves as the solution is designed and implemented, and the&#xD;
    architecture documentation is updated to reflect any changes made during development. This is&amp;nbsp;a key,&amp;nbsp;since&#xD;
    the actual implementation is the only real &quot;proof&quot; that the software architecture is viable and provides the definitive&#xD;
    basis for validating the suitability&amp;nbsp;of the architecture.&amp;nbsp; For more information, see &lt;a&#xD;

&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Identifying components will help hide the complexity of the system and help you work at a higher level. Components need&#xD;
    to be internally cohesive and to provide external services through a limited interface.&amp;nbsp; At this point, interfaces&#xD;
    do not need to be as detailed as a signature, but they do need to document what the elements need, what they can use,&#xD;
    and what they can depend on.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Component identification can be&amp;nbsp;based on architectural layers, deployment choices, or key abstractions. Ask&#xD;
    yourself these questions:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What is logically or functionally related (same use case or service, for example)?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What entities provide services to multiple others?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What entities depend on each other? Strongly or weakly?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What entities should you be able to exchange independently from others?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What will run on the same processor or network node?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What parts are constrained by similar performance requirements?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    When you identify a component be sure to briefly describe the functionality that should be allocated to the components.&#xD;

            <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h3>
    Introduction
</h3>
<p>
    Run this activity as a way to perform goal-based planning and execution. Work is taken on by developers, and work
    progress is tracked based on the goals achieved using the designed, developer-tested, and integrated source code.
</p>
<h4>
    Context of what is being developed
</h4>
<p>
    A context can be specified when a requirement is assigned to be developed, thus specifying how broadly a requirement is
    to be developed in an iteration. Development may focus on a layer (such as the user interface, business logic, or
    database access), on a component, and so on.
</p>
<p>
    Whether a context is specified or not, the developer's responsibility is to create a design and implementation for that
    requirement.&nbsp;The developer&nbsp;also writes and runs developer tests against the implementation to make sure that
    it works as designed, both as a unit and integrated into the code base.
</p>
<h4>
    Overview of workflow
</h4>
<p>
    Typical changes require some effort in designing the solution before moving into implementation, even if it is only a
    mental exercise that results in no long-term work product. The design for trivial changes to the existing
    implementation (to, for example, support some requirement) might be self-evident in the context of the existing
    architecture and design.
</p>
<p>
    Once the organization of the technical solution is clear, define developer tests that will verify the implementation.
    This test-driven approach ensures that design considerations have in fact taken place before the solution is coded. The
    tests are run up front and, if they fail, clearly define the criteria to determine if the implementation works as
    intended.
</p>
<p>
    Failed tests lead to&nbsp;an implementation of the solution, upon completion of which you run the tests again. This
    innermost loop of implementation and developer testing is repeated until the tests pass.
</p>
<p>
    Passing the tests does not necessarily mean that the solution is a high-quality, appropriate solution. It is proper to
    revisit the design at this point. That path loops back through the process, since any changes to the design could
    affect the developer tests and implementation.
</p>
<p>
    Once the tests pass and the design of the solution is appropriate, there is one more possible loopback. It is best to
    keep the test-driven, evolutionary design inner loops as tight as possible. Come up with some small-scale design
    solution for a part of the work item, define a test or two for the implementation of that one part of the solution,
    pass that test, verify the quality, and then continue on in a test-first manner until that part of the design is
    working. Then, in the outermost loop of the activity, go back to the work item and design another chunk to get closer
    to completion.

    This activity occurs multiple times during each iteration. Usually, there is one instance for each work item planned
    for that iteration. When instantiated in a project plan, the pattern becomes a development task to be taken on by one
    or more developers, and you should rename it to include the actual requirement name. Optionally, the words <b>Solution
    Increment</b>&nbsp;may be suppressed, then you can instantiate the pattern this way:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p align="left">
        Develop requirement_name (within context_name context)
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    If a context is specified, there will be one instance of this pattern for each requirement for each context.
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <b>Example</b>
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Develop scenario 1 (within user interface context)
        </li>
        <li>
            Develop scenario 1 (within business logic and database access context)
        </li>
        <li>
            Develop scenario 2
        </li>
        <li>
            Develop supplemental requirement 1
        </li>
    </ol>
</blockquote>
<p>
    Note that there are four instances of this pattern in the preceding example:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The first two are related to the same requirement (scenario 1) but within two different contexts
    </li>
    <li>
        The last two are related to different requirements, with no context specified.
    </li>
</ul>]]></UsageNotes>

              <KeyConsiderations><![CDATA[<p>
    Each step in this task can cause all previous steps to be revisited in light of new information and decisions.&nbsp;
    For example, while determining how elements collaborate&nbsp;you might find a gap in the requirements that causes you
    to go back to the beginning after collaborating with the analyst, or when evaluating the design a reviewer
    could&nbsp;note that a reusable element being used doesn't work as expected and that could cause you to identify new
    elements to take its place.
</p>
<p>
    Consider the architecture while performing this task.&nbsp; All design work must be done while regarding the
    architecture within which the design exists.&nbsp; Furthermore, certain design elements will be deemed architecturally
    significant; those elements will require updates to the architecture.
</p>
<p>
    This task will be applied numerous times.&nbsp; Design is best performed in small chunks.
</p>
<p>
    Even when starting the design for a particular project it&nbsp;is expected that there will be existing frameworks and
    reusable elements.&nbsp; Every step of this task must give attention to the existing design and existing
    implementation, utilizing existing elements when possible and emulating or improving existing elements as appropriate
    while designing this portion of the solution.
</p>
<p>
    Apply patterns throughout this task.&nbsp; Patterns represent proven designs and their usage promotes quality and
    consistency across the design.
</p>]]></KeyConsiderations>
              <RefinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This task is about designing part of the system, not the whole system.&amp;nbsp; It should be applied based upon some small&#xD;
    subset of requirements.&amp;nbsp; The requirements driving the design could be scenario-based functional requirements,&#xD;
    non-functional requirements, or a combination.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This task can be applied in some specific context such as the database access elements required for some&#xD;
    scenario.&amp;nbsp; In this case the task might be applied&amp;nbsp;again later&amp;nbsp;to deal with a different context on the&#xD;
    same requirements.&amp;nbsp; Keep in mind that to actually build some functionality of value&amp;nbsp;to the users, all&#xD;
    contexts will typically need to be designed and implemented. For example, to actually utilize some system capability it&#xD;
    will have to have been designed and implemented all its context such as user interface, business rules, database&#xD;
    access, etc.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For cohesion and completeness, this task is described as an end-to-end pass of designing a scenario of system usage. In&#xD;
    practice, this task will be revisited many times as the design is first considered, portions are implemented, more&#xD;
    design is performed based on what was learned, etc. The healthiest application of this task is in very close proximity&#xD;
    to the implementation.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If this task is being performed on an architecturally significant element the results of this design should be&#xD;

    Identify the elements that collaborate together to provide the required behavior. This can start with the key&#xD;
    abstractions identified in the Architecture Notebook, design, domain analysis, and classical analysis of the&#xD;
    requirements (noun filtering) to derive the elements that would be required to fulfill them. The &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;

    Walk through the scenario distributing responsibilities to the participating elements and ensuring that the elements&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    These responsibilities can be simple statements of behavior assigned to elements; they need not be detailed operation&#xD;
    specifications with parameters, etc. Similarly, the relationships can just be defined at this step. This step is about&#xD;
    ensuring that a quality model is being created that is robust enough to support the requirements. See &lt;a&#xD;

    Refine the design to an appropriate level of detail to drive implementation and to ensure that it fits into the&#xD;
    architecture. In this step the design can take into consideration the actual implementation language and other&#xD;
    technical decisions. Revisit the identification of the elements and the collaborations that realize the scenarios if&#xD;
    necessary as this refinement takes into consideration details at a lower level of abstraction. Discuss testability&#xD;
    issues, such as design elements that are difficult to test or critical performance areas, with the tester and&#xD;
    architect.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Evolve the design by examining recent changes in the larger context of the design and determine if refactoring and&#xD;

    This might just involve devising an algorithm that could be performed to produce the desired behavior. Add additional&#xD;
    operations, attributes, and relationships to support the expectations of an element.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Design the state of the element over the course of its lifetime to ensure its proper behavior in various circumstances.&#xD;

    Communicate&amp;nbsp;the system's design to&amp;nbsp;those who need to understand it. Though this is described here toward the&#xD;
    end of the task, communication should be going on throughout the steps. Working collaboratively is always better than&#xD;
    reviewing the work after it is complete.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Here are some ways to communicate&amp;nbsp;the design:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Formal models&amp;nbsp;specified in UML.&#xD;

        Informal diagrams that render static structure and capture&amp;nbsp;dynamic behavior.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Annotated code that communicates information about the static structure. This can be&amp;nbsp;supplemented with textual&#xD;
        descriptions of collaborative behavior across code modules.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Data models to describe the database schema.&#xD;

    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Developers&amp;nbsp;who will implement a solution based on the design.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Architects who can review the design to ensure that it conforms to the architecture or who might examine the design&#xD;
        for opportunities to improve the architecture.&#xD;

    perspectives on design quality and adherence to the architecture. However, when identifying potential reviewers keep in&#xD;
    mind that if someone can add value by reviewing the design, then perhaps they could have added even more value by&#xD;

    This work product describes the elements that will make up the implemented system. It communicates abstractions of&#xD;
    particular portions of the implementation.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    While architecture focuses on interfaces, patterns, and key decisions, the design fleshes out the technical details in&#xD;
    readiness for implementation, or as part of implementation.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This product can describe multiple static and dynamic views of the system for examination. Although various views may&#xD;

    Developer testing is different from other forms of testing in that it is based on the expected behavior of code units&#xD;
    rather than being directly based on the system requirements.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is best to do this at a small scale, much smaller than the complete code base to be authored by a developer over the&#xD;
    course of an iteration. This can be done for one operation, one field added to a user interface, one stored procedure,&#xD;
    etc. As the code base is incrementally built, new tests will be authored and existing tests might be revisited to test&#xD;
    additional behavior.&#xD;

    This artifact covers all of the steps to validate a specific aspect of an implementation element. For example, a test&#xD;
    could ensure that the parameters of a method properly accept the uppermost and lowermost required values. A developer&#xD;
    test specifies test entries, execution conditions, and expected results. These details are identified to evaluate a&#xD;
    particular aspect of a scenario.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;

              <Description>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Write the source code to make the implementation conform to the design and expected behavior. You should strive to&#xD;
    reuse and/or generate code wherever possible, but you will still need to do some programming. To do so, consider the&#xD;
    following:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Examine the technical requirements. Because some requirement information does not translate directly into your&#xD;
        design you should examine the requirement(s) to ensure that they are fully realized in the implementation.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Refactor your code to improve its design. Refactoring is a technique where you improve the quality of your code via&#xD;
        small, safe changes.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Tune the results of the existing implementation by improving performance, the user interface, security, and other&#xD;
        nonfunctional areas.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Add missing details, such as completing the logic of operations or adding supporting classes and data structures&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Handle boundary conditions.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Deal with unusual circumstances or error states.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Restrict behavior (preventing users or client code from executing illegal flows, scenarios, or combinations of&#xD;
        options).&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Add critical sections for multi-threaded or re-entrant code.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Though many different considerations are listed here, there is one clear way to know when the source code is done. The&#xD;
    solution has been implemented when it passes the developer tests. Any other considerations can be taken care of in a&#xD;
    refactoring pass over the code to improve it once it is complete and correct.&#xD;
&lt;/p></Description>

              <Description>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Verify that the implementation is fit for its purpose. Examine the code for its suitability to perform its intended&#xD;
    function. This is a quality assurance step that you perform in addition to testing which is described in other tasks.&#xD;
    Consider these strategies:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Pair programming. By pairing to implement the code in the first place, you effectively evaluate the code as its&#xD;
        being written.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Read through the code for common mistakes. Consider keeping a checklist of common mistakes that you make, as a&#xD;
        reminder reference.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Use tools to check for implementation errors and inappropriate code. For example, use a static code rule checker or&#xD;
        set the compiler to the most detailed warning level.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Use tools that can visualize the code. Code visualization, such as the UML visualizations in the Eclipse IDE, help&#xD;
        developers identify issues such as excessive coupling or circular dependencies.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Perform informal, targeted code inspections. Ask colleagues to review small critical sections of code and code with&#xD;
        significant churn. Avoid reviewing large sections of code.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Use&amp;nbsp;a tester to ensure the implementation is testable and understandable to testing resources.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Improve the implementation based on the results of these evaluations.&#xD;

              <Description>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Communicate the impact of unexpected changes to the design and requirements.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The issues and constraints that you uncover when you implement the system must be communicated to the team. The impact&#xD;
    of issues discovered during implementation must be incorporated into future decisions. If appropriate, use&amp;nbsp; the&#xD;
    change management process to reflect ambiguities that you identified and resolved in the implementation so they can be&#xD;
    tested and you can manage&amp;nbsp;stakeholder expectations appropriately. Similarly,&amp;nbsp;leverage the design process to&#xD;
    update the design to reflect new constraints and issues uncovered during implementation to be sure that the new&#xD;
    information is communicated to other developers.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Usually, there is no need for a change request if the required change is small and the same person is designing and&#xD;
    implementing the code element. That individual can make the design change directly. If the required change has a broad&#xD;
    impact, it may be necessary to communicate that change to the other team members through a change request.&#xD;

    This activity is repeated throughout the project lifecycle. The main goal of this activity is to validate that the
    current build of the system satisfies the requirements allocated to it.
</p>
<p>
    Throughout the iterations, your intent is to validate that the implemented requirements reflect a robust architecture,
    and that the remaining requirements are consistently implemented on top of that architecture. As developers implement
    the solution for the requirements in a given iteration, unit test the integrated source code. Then, a
    tester&nbsp;conducts system-level testing in parallel with development to make sure that the solution, which is
    continuously being integrated, satisfies the intent specified in the test cases. The tester defines what techniques to
    use, what the data input is, and what test suites to create. As tests run, defects are identified and added to the work
    items list, so that they can be prioritized as part of the work that you will do during iterations.
</p>
<p>
    stakeholders and end-users also may also be involved in performing tests to accept the release.

    A test case specifies the conditions that must be validated to enable an assessment of aspects of the system under&#xD;
    test. A test case is more formal than a test idea; typically, a test case takes the form of a specification. In less&#xD;
    formal environments, you can create test cases by identifying a unique ID, name, associated test data, and expected&#xD;
    results.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Test cases can be derived from many sources, and typically include a subset of the requirements (such as use cases,&#xD;
    performance characteristics, and reliability concerns) and other types of quality attributes. For more information on&#xD;
    types of tests and their relationships to quality test attributes, see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

    Post the test results in a conspicuous place that is accessible to the entire team, such as a white board or Wiki.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For each failing test script, analyze the Test Log to identify the cause of the test failure. Begin with failing tests&#xD;
    that you expected to begin passing against this build, which may indicate newly delivered work items that do not meet&#xD;
    the conditions of satisfaction. Then review previously passing test scripts that are now failing, which may indicate&#xD;
    regressive issues in the build.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        If a test failed because the solution does not meet the conditions of satisfaction for the test case, log the issue&#xD;
        in the Work Items List. In the work item, clearly identify the observed behavior, the expected behavior, and steps&#xD;
        to repeat the issue. Note which failing test initially discovered the issue.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        If a test failed because of a change in the system (such as a user-interface change), but the implementation still&#xD;
        meets the conditions of satisfaction in the test case, update the test script to pass with the new implementation.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        If a test failed because the test script is incorrect (a false negative result) or passed when it was expected to&#xD;
        fail (a false positive result), update the test script to correctly implement the conditions of satisfaction in the&#xD;
        test case. If the test case for a requirement is invalid, create a request change to modify the conditions of&#xD;
        satisfaction for the requirement.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It's best to update test scripts as quickly and continuously as possible. If the change to the test script is trivial,&#xD;
    update the test while analyzing the test results. If the change is a non-trivial task, submit it to the Work Items List&#xD;
    so it can be prioritized against other tasks.&#xD;

    so that the code can be fixed before the next release attempt. This is a critical step, but it should be done quickly&#xD;

              <RefinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Release controls describe the minimum number of requirements that a software package must adhere to before being&#xD;
    released into production. This is especially important if a development team is new or emerging, because they might not be&#xD;
    aware of the great responsibilities a Deployment Manager has. In fact, a Deployment Manager is responsible to senior&#xD;
    management for ensuring that nothing is placed into production that does not conform to the rigid controls designed to&#xD;
    protect the IT organization's ability to successfully deliver IT services to internal and external Customers.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Release controls typically consist of:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Release or deployment plan&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

    &lt;li>&#xD;

    Coordinated releases at the program level are very formal processes. They are formal for a very good reason - namely,&#xD;
    the company's production environment could be corrupted and serious business ramifications could result, including:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Lost revenue&#xD;

    A release package cannot be deployed to production if the environmental infrastructure within which the release will be&#xD;
    run is not sufficiently built or tested. Whether the release is deployed as a &quot;push&quot; (where the application is deployed&#xD;
    from a central point and proactively delivered to target locations) or a &quot;pull&quot; (where the application is made&#xD;
    available at central point and pulled by a user at a time of their choosing), the infrastructure needed to support the&#xD;
    application must be considered and implemented.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Some key aspects of installing and/or validating the desired infrastructure:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Identify the requirements and components of the environment configuration&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Determine the lead times required to establish the infrastructure environments&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Procure and install the infrastructure components that are not yet available&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Test the newly installed infrastructure components&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Test the integration of newly installed components with the rest of the environmental configuration&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Validate other aspects of the infrastructure including: &#xD;
        &lt;ul>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Security components and their integration&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Database connectivity and security&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;

    When a release is pushed to production, all the stakeholders of that product should be notified that the event has&#xD;
    happened and what the release means to each of the stakeholders. Often, the output of this task does not need to be&#xD;
    created from scratch; for products that plan multiple releases, just updating the communique details for each release&#xD;
    might be enough. However, if any of the stakeholder groups change, or there is a significant difference in the product&#xD;
    distribution, more significant content might need to be developed.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In any case, communicating effectively to the End User community is important. A development team can develop high quality&#xD;
    software, but if messaging to the stakeholders is conducted poorly or not at all, the End User experience might be&#xD;
    degraded. By simply answering the questions &quot;who, what, when, where, why, and how&quot; in a format appropriate for each&#xD;
    stakeholder group, a product release can become a more satisfying experience for all those involved.&#xD;

    Some common release controls are:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A release or deployment plan must be documented and reviewed with the Deployment Manager (or the release&#xD;
        organization). This plan must address how risks, issues, or code deviations are to be handled during the key&#xD;
        timeframe leading up to the actual release&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The components of each release package must be defined, integrated, and compatible with one another&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The integrity of each release package must be verified and maintained&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

        References to the configuration items (CIs) that the release package represents, if applicable&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The customer for which the application is being developed must approve the release, indicating that the user&#xD;
        community (or a specific subset) is ready to receive and use the requisite capabilities of the release&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Each release package must be capable of being backed out of production without negatively impacting the remaining&#xD;
        production environment&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The contents of each release package must be transferred to operations and support staff with sufficient&#xD;
        documentation and knowledge transfer so that those organizations can effectively support the released capabilities&#xD;
        in production&#xD;

    While someone on the development team normally authors a draft version of the Backout Plan, the Deployment Engineer is&#xD;
    ultimately responsible for its contents and existence. A Backout Plan typically answers the following questions:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Under what circumstances will a rollback be required? Or conversely, under what circumstances will the deployment&#xD;
        be considered a success?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What is the time period within which a rollback can take place?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Which authorizing agent will make the decision to revert?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Who will perform the rollback and how soon after the decision has been made will the rollback be performed?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What procedures (manual and automated) will be followed to execute the rollback?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What other contingency measures or available workarounds should be considered?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What is the expected time required to perform a reversion?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What are the communication procedures required in the event of a backout?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

    Sometimes, depending on the product user base, separate communiques might need to be prepared for each stakeholder&#xD;
    group. In that case, this artifact should specify the different groups to which communications are directed, the method&#xD;
    of communication (e.g., email, text or pager message, bulletin, newsletter, phone message, etc.). All communiques&#xD;
    should be prepared in advance so that it is a matter of disseminating information when the release to production has&#xD;
    been determined to be successful.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Also included in this artifact is a listing of the responsible parties who will execute the communications when a&#xD;
    successful release has been declared (normally the Deployment Engineer), as well as the timing and dependencies of the&#xD;
    communiques.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    While there is no prescribed format for the Release Communications artifact, each communique should indicate the&#xD;
    preferred delivery mechanisms (e.g., beeper notification, telephone calls, a posting to an internal release website,&#xD;
    live or pre-recorded presentations by senior management, etc.) and generally answer the following questions:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Who are the parties (Stakeholders) that are interested in knowing that a release to production has taken place?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What specifically (features, functions, components) has been placed into production?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Why is this release valuable to stakeholders and what business purpose does it serve?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Where is the product available (on which platforms, geographical locations, business units, etc.)?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        How can the stakeholders access the system and under what circumstances?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        When was the product released (or when will it be released if the release date is in the future)?&#xD;

              <RefinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Development team members sometimes take documentation for granted, or do not give it enough consideration. However,&#xD;
    after a product is delivered, Customers who pay for the system and for support often do not have enough information to&#xD;
    effectively manage the product.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If a Technical Writer is made available to a development team, that role often takes the burden off the team for&#xD;
    developing the formal product documentation and for ensuring that it is in the correct format and business language. If&#xD;
    a Technical Writer is not available, the development team and Product Owner must make every effort to create enough&#xD;
    documentation to ensure that the features that have been developed for each Release are understood and can be&#xD;
    communicated effectively by the paying Customer to their stakeholders.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Delivering a professionally developed product requires that a development team provide the Customer with accurate,&#xD;
    detailed, and comprehensive product documentation.&#xD;

    Support documentation often is the most overlooked aspect of a documentation effort. Anyone who has had the opportunity&#xD;
    to provide End User support for a particular application can appreciate how important effective, well-written support&#xD;
    documentation can be. This documentation very often is technical in nature and differs significantly from user or&#xD;
    product documentation, which normally is written for the lay person.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The development team should do its best to make sure that personnel who perform an IT support role have the right amount and&#xD;
    the relevant type of information necessary to support the application, whether they provide Tier 1, Tier 2, or Tier 3&#xD;
    support. Support documentation often is developed based on these three different support categories. How&#xD;
    effectively the code base is commented and the ease with which those comments are found and understood contributes to&#xD;
    the quality and quantity of support documentation.&#xD;

    This step is often challenging for development teams because they must put themselves in the position of IT support&#xD;
    personnel to develop the right kind and right amount of useful content. It is advantageous to visit the support&#xD;
    organization and ask them what types of documentation they would want delivered to them at each Release. You might be&#xD;
    surprised at what they say, and it could make your documentation tasks easier if you know exactly what type of&#xD;
    information they want.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Because every product is different, and because each program or IT support organization has unique needs, it is&#xD;
    impossible to list recommended contents for support documentation. However, each program should create support&#xD;
    documentation standards for the development teams that support its program.&#xD;

    Support documentation usually is developed for the three common tiers of a support organization. Tier 1 typically is&#xD;
    the Help Desk where users call when they have a problem with a particular system. Tier 1 support personnel&#xD;
    normally answer basic questions and, if necessary, log a ticket and escalate it to the appropriate Level 2 support&#xD;
    desk.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Tier 2 support personnel may deal with more complex questions or issues regarding an application and might need to&#xD;
    do some research on the characteristics of the system to provide an answer. If that person cannot resolve the&#xD;
    issue, the ticket is escalated to Tier 3 support personnel who have a deeper understanding of the application's&#xD;
    code and the technology support the system's architecture.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    To properly convey the necessary information to each support tier, the application's code base should be well commented&#xD;
    and logically organized. This approach will facilitate the development of the support documentation.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Support documentation typically includes:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        User manuals with work instructions, process descriptions, and procedures&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

    Having the correct amount and type of materials available to adequately train End Users and supporters of an&#xD;
    application is necessary to promote usability and to achieve the desired business value. If a Course Developer is&#xD;
    available, they can assume most of the burden of creating the training materials, lab exercises, and workshops&amp;nbsp;for&#xD;
    delivery of&amp;nbsp;those courses to either End Users or support personnel. If a Course Developer is not&#xD;
    available,&amp;nbsp;Development team members should take the time to properly develop a suite of training materials for the&#xD;
    feature set developed during a Release.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Although different parts of training materials should be created during Feature Development Sprint/Iterations, the bulk of the&#xD;
    work (and the integration of the materials) usually is reserved for the Release Sprint/Iteration that occurs immediately before a&#xD;
    scheduled Release.&#xD;

    Often, a Trainer will deliver training to End Users; rarely will the development team deliver training because&#xD;
    they are busy developing additional features for this or other systems. If a Trainer is not available, the&#xD;
    Product Owner might have to train the End Users.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    End User training usually consists of presentation slides, job aids, hands-on labs and exercises, or workshops that&#xD;
    integrate these methods into an environment that the End Users can understand and relate to.&#xD;

    Because a Release ultimately will have to be supported by Help Desk or other technical personnel, a set of training&#xD;
    materials designed to convey key concepts to those individuals must be developed and delivered by the&amp;nbsp;Development&#xD;
    Team or by a technically oriented Trainer.&#xD;

    Delivery of this training might include presentation slides, job aids, lab exercises, or workshops designed to provide&#xD;

    Support documentation usually is developed for the three common tiers of a support organization. Tier 1 typically is&#xD;
    the Help Desk where users call when they have a problem with a particular system. Tier 1 support personnel&#xD;
    normally answer basic questions and, if necessary, log a ticket and escalate it to the appropriate Level 2 support&#xD;
    desk.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Tier 2 support personnel may deal with more complex questions or issues regarding an application and might need to&#xD;
    do some research on the characteristics of the system to provide an answer. If that person cannot resolve the&#xD;
    issue, the ticket is escalated to Tier 3 support personnel who have a deeper understanding of the application's&#xD;
    code and the technology support the system's architecture.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    To properly convey the necessary information to each support tier, the application's code base should be well commented&#xD;
    and logically organized. This approach will facilitate the development of the support documentation.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Support documentation typically includes:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        User manuals with work instructions, process descriptions, and procedures&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

</p>
<p>
    Each phase may have as many iterations as needed (depending on the degree of novelty of the business domain, the
    technology being used, architectural complexity, and project size, to name a few factors).
</p>
<p>
    To offer a quick start for teams to plan their iterations, OpenUP provides work breakdown structure (WBS) templates for
    each iteration, and a WBS template for an end-to-end process.
</p>
<p>
    Iterations may have variable lengths, depending on project characteristics. One-month iterations are typically
    recommended, because this timeframe provides:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        A reasonable amount of time for projects to deliver meaningful increments in functionality.
    </li>
    <li>
        Early and frequent customer feedback.
    </li>
    <li>
        Timely management of risks and issues during the course of the project.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    OpenUP is intended to offer process guidance to small, co-located teams.

<h3>
    Why Practices?
</h3>
<p>
    Practices enable a new approach to building methods - practice composition.
</p>
<p>
    This approach offers the following benefits:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Adaptability and scalability
    </li>
    <li>
        Incremental adoption
    </li>
    <li>
        Easy to configure and use
    </li>
    <li>
        Community development
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Adaptability and Scalability
</h3>
<p>
    The set of practices included in the&nbsp;Open Source&nbsp;Practices for Agile Projects supports a range of
    solutions.&nbsp;In particular, these agile practices can be adapted to suit your organization and supplemented by your
    own practices.&nbsp;
</p>
<h3>
    Incremental Adoption
</h3>
<p>
    Each practice is described as a standalone capability that can be adopted by an organization or project.&nbsp;Each
    practice may include enablement materials that explain how to get started.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<h3>
    Easy to Configure and Use
</h3>
<p>
    Creating a method is as simple as selecting the practices that you wish to adopt, and then publishing the
    results.&nbsp;Each practice adds itself into the framework so that content can be viewed by practice, or across
    practices by work product, role, task and so on.
</p>
<h3>
    Community Development
</h3>
<p>
    Since a practice can be easily authored on its own, practices are ideal for community development.&nbsp;The basic agile
    practices for the&nbsp;Open Source&nbsp;Practice Library are, in fact, developed by the Eclipse Process Framework
    community.&nbsp;

          <MainDescription><![CDATA[<p>
    A <a class="elementLink" href="./../../core.default.uma_concept.base/guidances/termdefinitions/discipline_7667F451.html" guid="_yGUuidnmEdmO6L4XMImrsA">discipline</a> is a collection of <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../core.default.uma_concept.base/guidances/termdefinitions/task_6C1FF051.html" guid="_x459ktnmEdmO6L4XMImrsA">tasks</a> that are related to a major "area of concern" within the overall project.
    Grouping tasks into disciplines is mainly an aid to understanding the project from a traditional waterfall perspective.
    Although it is more common to perform tasks concurrently across several disciplines (for example, certain requirements
    tasks are performed in close coordination with analysis and design tasks), separating these tasks into distinct
    disciplines is simply an effective way to organize content, which makes comprehension easier.
</p>
<p>
    Another reason that several tasks are all categorized by the same discipline is that they represent a part in achieving
    a higher goal, or performing work tasks that are all related to each other. Every discipline defines standard ways of
    doing the work it categorizes. Such standard ways are expressed by so-called <b>reference workflows</b> described with
    <a class="elementLink" href="./../../core.default.uma_concept.base/guidances/termdefinitions/capability_pattern_F5DDC5F.html" guid="_2RUJACO4EdqaNq6Ptg8uyA">capability pattern</a>s, which define how the tasks categorized by the discipline work
    together (in the most generic way). These reference workflows are often used for educating and teaching practitioners.
</p>
<p>
    Like other workflows, a discipline's reference workflow is a semi-ordered sequence of activities, presented as either a
    breakdown structure or an activity diagram performed to achieve a particular result. The "semi-ordered" nature of
    discipline workflows emphasizes that the discipline workflows cannot present the real nuances of scheduling real work,
    for they cannot depict the optionality of activities, or the iterative nature of real projects. Yet they still have
    value as a way for us to understand the process, by breaking it into smaller areas of concern.

          <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h3>
    Introduction
</h3>
<p>
    A good way to understand OpenUP is to think of it as targeted to teams that have the following objectives:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Apply the minimally necessary process that brings value.
    </li>
    <li>
        Avoid being overloaded with unproductive formal work products.
    </li>
    <li>
        Use a process that can be tailored and extended for additional needs that may arise during the software development
        lifecycle.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    In order to be applied to as many project environments as possible, OpenUP is a process that has the following
    characteristics:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Minimal - only fundamental content is included
    </li>
    <li>
        Complete - it can be manifested as an entire process to build a system
    </li>
    <li>
        Extensible - it can be used as a foundation on which process content can be added or tailored as needed
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Minimal
</h4>
<p>
    OpenUP is considered an agile, lightweight process that promotes software development best practices such as:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        iterative development
    </li>
    <li>
        team collaboration
    </li>
    <li>
        continuous integration and tests
    </li>
    <li>
        frequent deliveries of working software
    </li>
    <li>
        adaptation to changes, and so on.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Other factors also count when determining the size of process material, such as the number of method elements like
    roles, tasks, artifacts and guidance.
</p>
<p>
    OpenUP provides descriptions of responsibilities, skills and competencies of the fundamental roles in a team. See the
    list of <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../core.default.nav_view.base/customcategories/role_list_4C636D88.html" guid="_WCIHZMRdEdyD76CYS6Ta7A">Roles</a>&nbsp;for more details.
</p>
<p>
    OpenUP provides the essential artifacts needed to capture and communicate decisions. Ultimately, the process is not
    governed by artifact creation. For example, thinking about design is more important than documenting the design;
    assessing and planning an iteration is about promoting team collaboration instead of creating plans that are written in
    stone. In addition, for each artifact, OpenUP suggests informal representations or provides informal templates as
    starting points for teams that do not need to create their own. The team decides what the most appropriate form to be
    applied is. See the list of <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../core.default.nav_view.base/customcategories/work_products_FB13601A.html" guid="__O1Y8MRgEdyD76CYS6Ta7A">Work Products</a>&nbsp;organized by domains.
</p>
<p>
    Tasks in OpenUP are clear and focused on results. Text is usually short and objective, describing how individuals
    should collaborate to achieve objectives. Steps are short descriptions of what to achieve, and point to external
    guidance on how to do it. See the list of&nbsp;<a class="elementLink" href="./../../../core.default.nav_view.base/customcategories/tasks_E310E5A5.html" guid="_CXQicMRhEdyD76CYS6Ta7A">Tasks</a>&nbsp;organized by disciplines.
</p>
<p>
    OpenUP recommends the least amount of process guidance a team should use in order to be successful. Teams may have
    different names or responsibilities for roles, may perform tasks in or have different representations for artifacts,
    but they still want to follow the principles and practices described in OpenUP to increase the chances of project
    success.
</p>
<h4>
    Complete
</h4>
<p>
    OpenUP is considered a complete process because it covers the essential disciplines in a software development lifecycle
    by guiding the team in the following high level activities:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Customer needs and requirements are elicited and captured, with continuous customer involvement.
    </li>
    <li>
        A robust architecture for the system is evolved, addressing technical risks and promoting team organization.
    </li>
    <li>
        For each requirement, a technical solution is designed, implemented and tested, which conforms to the architectural
        decisions.
    </li>
    <li>
        The system is evaluated by tests that validate customer requirements.
    </li>
    <li>
        Defects and enhancements feed back into development.
    </li>
    <li>
        Work is prioritized, iterations are planned and assessed, and team members take on work to be done.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    However, OpenUP assumes that the project team is not responsible for certain activities and decisions that are assigned
    to other areas of the organization, such as:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Creation of the business case is dealt with by management who decides whether or not the project is worth investing
        in, what is the return on investment, and so on.
    </li>
    <li>
        Environment setup - some organizational issues may not be in the scope of the team, such as: installation,
        configuration and licensing of development tools and configuration management tools; development process
        customization and publishing, etc.
    </li>
    <li>
        Deployment and operation - addressed at an organizational rather than a team level.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Other areas of concern are also not present in OpenUP, because small teams do not need to deal with the formality or
    overhead of these areas. They include, but are not limited to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Advanced configuration management
    </li>
    <li>
        Advanced requirements management
    </li>
    <li>
        Program and portfolio management
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Extensible
</h4>
<p>
    OpenUP can be adopted by projects as it is, out-of-the-box, because it's minimal and complete.
</p>
<p>
    However, different projects may have different needs. Organizations may be interested in customizing some aspects of
    OpenUP to adapt it to their projects. These are some examples of possible customization:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Add new or rename existing roles
    </li>
    <li>
        Add steps to existing tasks
    </li>
    <li>
        Create new guidelines on a given technique
    </li>
    <li>
        Remove a given content area
    </li>
    <li>
        Modify existing or add new templates to artifacts
    </li>
    <li>
        Modify or create a new process lifecycle
    </li>
    <li>
        Add or remove process content
    </li>
    <li>
        Add guidance on how to achieve compliance
    </li>
    <li>
        Add guidance specific to a technology being used
    </li>
    <li>
        Replace or augment&nbsp;one of the layers with new&nbsp;content (e.g. by changing&nbsp;or adding material to how
        management is performed)
    </li>
    <li>
        Etc.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    OpenUP can be customized and extended by using the EPF Composer tool, which allows you to author, configure and publish
    methods. With EPF Composer, you can add, remove and change elements according to your team needs, then publish the
    content to serve as guidance for your team.

    OpenUP is most useful for four primary groups of users:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Software development practitioners (developers, project managers, analysts, and testers) working together as a
        project team
    </li>
    <li>
        stakeholders
    </li>
    <li>
        Software process engineers
    </li>
    <li>
        Instructors
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Software development practitioners can find guidance on what is required of them in the roles defined by OpenUP. Each
    role describes a set of activities and artifacts for which the role is responsible. Guidance is also given on how those
    roles collaborate.
</p>
<p>
    stakeholders will find guidance on what they may expect from the software development team, and how the software will
    be created. OpenUP also describes the stakeholders' responsibilities, and states how they can best work with the
    development team to obtain software that meets their needs.
</p>
<p>
    Software process engineers can use EPF Composer to extend and modify OpenUP. Modification may be as simple as altering
    templates for work products, or as sophisticated as adding activities necessary for creating software in your specific
    environment (such as audits for safety-critical systems). In addition to modifying method content, process engineers
    can add, change, or remove process flows to add organization-specific capability patterns.
</p>
<p>
    OpenUP is appropriate for academic organizations also. As an open source process, it can serve as the basis for
    software engineering courses and, when combined with the EPF Composer, courses in software process engineering.<br />

          <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h3>
    Overview of OpenUP
</h3>
<p>
    OpenUP is for small teams who work together in the same location. The team needs to engage in plenty of daily
    face-to-face interaction. Team members include the stakeholders, developers, architects, project manager, and testers.
    They make their own decisions about what they need to work on, what the priorities are, and how best to address
    stakeholder needs. The organization must support the team by allowing them these responsibilities.
</p>
<p>
    Team members collaborate extensively. The presence of stakeholders as team members is critical to successfully
    implementing OpenUP.
</p>
<p>
    Team members participate in daily stand-up meetings to communicate status and issues. Problems are addressed outside of
    the daily meetings.
</p>
<p>
    OpenUP focuses on significantly&nbsp;reducing risk early in the lifecycle. This requires regular risk review meetings
    and rigorous implementation of mitigation strategies.
</p>
<p>
    All work is listed, tracked, and assigned through the Work Items List. Team members use this single repository for all
    tasks that need to be recorded and tracked. This includes all change requests, bugs, and stakeholder requests.
</p>
<p>
    Use cases are used to elicit and describe requirements; therefore, team members need to develop skills in writing good
    use cases. stakeholders are responsible for reviewing and certifying that the requirements are correct. Use cases are
    developed collaboratively.
</p>
<p>
    Architecturally significant requirements must be identified and stabilized in the Elaboration phase so that a robust
    architecture can be created as the core of the system. An architecturally significant requirement change that must be
    addressed may arise later in development, but the risk of this happening is significantly reduced in the Elaboration
    iteration.
</p>
<p>
    Testing is performed multiple times per iteration, every time the solution is incremented with the development of a
    requirement, change, or bug fix. These tests happen after developers have developed the solution (which should have
    been unit-tested) and integrate it into the code base. These tests help guarantee that a stable build is created and
    always available as development progresses.
</p>
<p>
    OpenUP does not include content for deployment, configuration management, or the development environment (such as
    customizing this process or setting up development environments). OpenUP focuses on a single team, and these areas are
    generally addressed at an organizational or enterprise level. Look for extensions to OpenUP that address these wider
    areas.
</p>
<p>
    OpenUP is an iterative software development process that is minimal, complete, and extensible. It is governed by
    four&nbsp;core principles:

<h4>
    The OpenUP software development&nbsp;lifecycle
</h4>
<p>
    OpenUP is an iterative process&nbsp;distributed throughout&nbsp;four phases: Inception, Elaboration, Construction, and
    Transition. Each phase consists of one or more iterations where stable, working versions of the software are developed
    and released, with the completion of each iteration representing a minor <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../practice.mgmt.risk_value_lifecycle.base/guidances/concepts/phase_milestones_5678231E.html" guid="_HNxbwMBJEdqSgKaj2SZBmg">milestone</a>&nbsp;for the project and contributing to the successful achievement of the
    phase's major milestone, where phase objectives are met.

</p>
<h4>
    How&nbsp;to get started?
</h4>
<p>
    The fourth OpenUP core principle, "Evolve to continuously obtain feedback and improve", suggests an iterative and
    incremental approach to adopting OpenUP.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Start with the core principles and understand the intentions behind OpenUP.
    </li>
    <li>
        Then assess your existing process, and select one or two key areas that you would like to improve.
    </li>
    <li>
        Begin using OpenUP to improve these areas first.
    </li>
    <li>
        In later iterations or development cycles, make incremental improvements in other areas.
    </li>
    <li>
        If you have little or no experience with unified processes or other iterative processes, use OpenUP in a small
        pilot project, perhaps with only three to four people working for only two to three months.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    While OpenUP is a ready to use as-is, you may choose to extend the process or modify the work product templates to suit
    your specific needs. For example:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        You may require more or less precision in your work products.
    </li>
    <li>
        Your organization may have specific configuration management practices or safety protocols to include in your
        process.
    </li>
    <li>
        You may simply want to put your own corporate logo on the banner.
    </li>
    <li>
        You may want to incorporate lessons learned from a retrospective review into OpenUP.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Use EPF Composer to extend and tailor OpenUP. For more information about EPF composer, visit <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/epf" target="_blank">www.eclipse.org/epf</a>.

          <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h3>
    Introduction
</h3>
<p>
    Systems are rarely all things to all people. Often, attempts to make them so are wasteful, and result in bloated
    systems.
</p>
<p>
    To be successful, stakeholders and the project participants must converge on a clear understanding and agreement of
    these three factors:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Problem to be solved
    </li>
    <li>
        Constraints placed on the development team (cost, schedule, resources, regulations, and so on)
    </li>
    <li>
        Constraints placed on the solution
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The challenge for all project participants is creating a solution that maximizes the value delivered to the
    stakeholders, subject to the constraints. Balance is about making the critical, cost-benefit trade-offs between desired
    features and the subsequent design decisions that define the architecture of the system.
</p>
<p>
    Discovering the balance point is challenging, elusive, and ongoing, because the balance point is dynamic. As the system
    evolves, stakeholder needs change, new opportunities appear, risks are resolved, new risks appear, and the development
    team discovers new realities about the system. Change happens throughout the development cycle. stakeholders and team
    members must be prepared to re-evaluate commitments, reset expectations, and adjust plans accordingly as the system
    evolves.
</p>
<h3>
    Practices
</h3>
<h4>
    Know your audience
</h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        You cannot know how to make effective trade-offs if you do not know who the stakeholders are and what they really
        want.
    </p>
    <p>
        Get to know your stakeholders. Better yet, work closely with them to ensure that you know their needs. Start by
        identifying all stakeholders, and then maintain open and frequent communication and collaboration between them and
        the development team.
    </p>
</blockquote>
<h4>
    Separate the problem from the solution
</h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        Too often, we run headlong into a solution without understanding the problem. After all, we are taught how to solve
        problems, not how to define problems, so that's easier. However, this limits your understanding of the problem,
        imposes artificial constraints, and makes it difficult to balance trade-offs, or to even know what the trade-offs
        are.
    </p>
    <p>
        Make sure that you understand the problem before you define the solution. By clearly separating the problem (what
        the customer needs) from the solution (what the system must do), it is easier to maintain the proper focus, and
        easier to accommodate alternate ways of solving the problem.
    </p>
</blockquote>
<h4>
    Create a shared understanding of the domain
</h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        Domain experts often have limited technical expertise; developers, architects, and testers often have limited
        domain expertise; and reviewers and other stakeholders often have limited time to commit to the project and learn
        the problem domain. As a result, people often have an inconsistent or poor understanding of the problem domain,
        which causes communication problems and increases the likelihood of delivering poor value to the stakeholders.
    </p>
    <p>
        Enhance and share all parties' understandings of the domain. A concise and shared understanding of the problem
        domain enhances communication and project effectiveness. Start by defining the problem in the Vision document. As
        your understanding increases, capture key domain concepts and terminology in the Glossary to ensure a consistent,
        shared use of the language of the domain.
    </p>
</blockquote>
<h4>
    Use scenarios and use cases to capture requirements
</h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        Many companies still document requirements as a list of declarative statements, which are sometimes called the
        "shall statements." These lists are often difficult for stakeholders to understand, because they require the end
        user to read through and mentally translate the list into a visualization of how the requirements will interact
        with the system.
    </p>
    <p>
        Make use of scenarios and use cases to capture functional requirements in a form that is easy for stakeholders to
        understand. Nonfunctional requirements, such as performance, stability, or usability requirements, are important
        and can be documented as system-wide requirements, using traditional techniques.
    </p>
</blockquote>
<h4>
    Establish and maintain agreement on priorities
</h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        Making poor decisions in deciding what to develop next can result in wasted effort, delivering capabilities that
        are never used, or identifying problems late in the project (resulting in delays and even project failure).
    </p>
    <p>
        Prioritize requirements for implementation by regularly working with the stakeholders during product evolution.
        Make choices that deliver value and reduce risks, while building a system that can evolve.
    </p>
</blockquote>
<h4>
    Make trade-offs to maximize value
</h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        Cost-benefit trade-offs cannot be made independent of the architecture. Requirements establish the benefits of the
        system to the stakeholder, while architecture establishes the cost. The cost of a benefit may influence the
        stakeholder's perceived value of the benefit.
    </p>
    <p>
        Work with the stakeholders and team members to prioritize requirements and develop candidate architectures to
        implement those solutions. Use the candidate architectures to evaluate the cost of the benefits. Candidate
        solutions are considered at a high level when determining architectural feasibility. Different architectural
        perspectives can result in different assessments of cost versus benefit. The candidate architecture that provides
        the most coverage at the lowest cost is selected for further development.
    </p>
</blockquote>
<h4>
    Manage scope
</h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        Change is inevitable. Although change presents opportunities to enhance stakeholder value, unconstrained change
        will result in a bloated, deficient system and unmet stakeholder needs.
    </p>
    <p>
        Manage change while maintaining agreements with the stakeholders. Modern processes always manage change,
        continually adapting to changes in the environment and stakeholder needs, assessing the impact of changes, making
        trade-offs, and re-prioritizing work. stakeholder and developer expectations must be realistic and aligned
        throughout the development lifecycle.
    </p>
</blockquote>
<h4>
    Know when to stop
</h4>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        Over-engineering a system not only wastes resources, but also leads to an overly complex system.
    </p>
    <p>
        Stop developing the system when the desired quality is achieved. Remember that "Quality is conformance to the
        requirements" <a href="./../../../core.mgmt.common.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references.mgmt_D80619F3.html#CRO79" guid="_JlTPUM6aEdyuBO4ZIzcyig">[CRO79]</a>. This is what gives a sense of closure to the practice. Separate the
        problem from the solution, ensuring that the solution does, indeed, solve the problem. After the critical
        requirements are implemented and validated, the system is ready for stakeholder acceptance.
    </p>

          <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h3>
    Introduction
</h3>
<p>
    Software is created by people with different interests and skills who must work together to create software
    effectively.
</p>
<p>
    Develop practices that foster a healthy team environment. A healthy team environment enables effective collaboration,
    which aligns the interests of project participants (development team, quality assurance, product stakeholders, and
    customers) and helps project participants develop a shared understanding of the project.
</p>
<h3>
    Practices
</h3>
<h4>
    Maintain a common understanding
</h4>
<p>
    Project participants require a common understanding of a project to cooperate effectively. Otherwise, disorder sets in,
    because the team members cannot align their understanding and interests, and will then work with different purposes.
</p>
<p>
    Be proactive communicating and sharing information with project participants. Do not assume that everyone will just
    find what they need to know, or that each person has the same understanding of the project as everyone else. Use work
    products (such as the Vision, Work Items List, and Requirements) to align the understanding between the stakeholders
    and developers. Use the architecture to focus and align the interests of the developers. At the end of each iteration,
    get agreement on whether the iteration goals have been reached and, if not, what actions must be taken.
</p>
<h4>
    Foster a high-trust environment
</h4>
<p>
    People who do not feel safe will not communicate their ideas, take initiative, or admit their ignorance. In these
    low-trust work environments, activities must be laboriously planned in detail, carefully supervised, and extensively
    audited. A team working in a low-trust environment may not be able to keep up with rapid change.
</p>
<p>
    Take actions that foster a high-trust environment:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            <b>Manage by intent.</b> Create an environment where teams manage themselves, and managers serve as mentors to
            teams to help them complete their objectives.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <b>Tear down the walls.</b> Work to remove both the physical and mental barriers that inhibit development of a
            common understanding among project participants.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <b>Walk a mile (or 1.6 kilometers) in someone else's shoes.</b> Respect and try to understand the perspectives
            of others before criticizing their ideas or responding to their criticism.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <b>Respond to conversations with relevance.</b> People, especially technical workers, often respond with
            argument or disagreement, which leads to rivalry and establishes a pecking order in which only a few people
            contribute to the discussion. Develop and encourage behavior that values curiosity and relevance over argument
            and disagreement.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <b>Always look to yourself first for the source of communication problems.</b> Understand that everyone has a
            perspective that is largely invisible to the individual (although it is often obvious to everyone else).
            Develop the habit of identifying the assumptions and prejudices within you that lead to argument or lack of
            communication. Learn to overcome these in the moment of the conversation. This takes practice. There are times
            when others may be intractable, but often the problem can be addressed by wrestling with your own perspective.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <b>Understand the constraints of the workplace culture.</b> Some organizations operate in a way that allows
            people to admit mistakes, ask questions, and experiment. Some organizations limit these expressions, but they
            may change, with time and effort. Some organizations have no tolerance for error, and their workers put
            themselves in danger if they admit mistakes or experiment. Understand your environment and protect yourself
            accordingly. Understand that low-trust organizations have more problems in achieving their goals, and provide a
            less satisfying environment.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Share responsibility
</h4>
<p>
    There may be disadvantages for individuals when they work alone. Communication with the team can become sporadic, and
    then stop. People may get into trouble and not ask for help, or not realize that the team is in trouble and needs their
    help. Their understanding of the project may become misaligned with the rest of the team. In the worse situations,
    trust breaks down as individuals see the team working at different purposes to their interests.
</p>
<p>
    While individuals have primary responsibility for their work products, responsibility for work products is shared.
    Nothing is someone else's responsibility. This may mean either taking up slack and working with someone who is lagging
    for some reason, or asking for help. Experienced staff should be extra-vigilant and watch over less-experienced staff,
    encouraging them to ask for help if necessary.
</p>
<h4>
    Learn continuously
</h4>
<p>
    Not only is software development a fast-developing field where technical skills rapidly become obsolete, it is also an
    empirical process, where software is developed in a manner that sometimes resembles trial and error. Furthermore,
    software is developed by teams of people who must work together to achieve results.
</p>
<p>
    Continuously develop both your technical and interpersonal skills. Learn from the examples of your colleagues. Take the
    opportunity to be both a student of your colleagues, as well as a teacher to them. Always increase your personal
    ability to overcome your own antagonism toward other team members.
</p>
<h4>
    Organize around the architecture
</h4>
<p>
    As projects grow in size, communication between team members becomes increasingly complex. While all team members
    understand the overall system, they can focus primarily on the one or more subsystems that they are responsible for.
    Organizing around the architecture also helps with communication by providing the team with a common vocabulary and
    shared mental model of the system. Communication between team members becomes increasingly complex.
</p>
<p>
    Organize the team around the architecture, and the vocabulary and a shared mental model of the system. However, be
    careful that individuals and teams organized this way do not form a so-called <i>silo mentality</i>, where they focus
    strictly on their subsystems and become ignorant of the other subsystems.
</p>
<p>
    An architecture that reflects the organization's structure is not in itself evidence that the team has successfully
    organized around the architecture. If organizations and teams are not organized around the architecture, then the
    architecture will naturally conform to the organization, as a result of political and cultural influences. In the end,
    the architecture and the organization will almost always be a reflection of each other. The goal is to guide team
    organization from the needs of the architecture as much as possible.

    Introduction

<p>
    It is usually not possible to know all stakeholders' needs, be aware of all project risks, comprehend all project
    technologies, or know how to work with your colleagues. Even if it were possible to know all of these things, they are
    likely to change over the life of the project. Promote practices that allow the team to demonstrate incremental value,

    The intention behind this principle is to continuously get feedback, and to improve both the product and the process of
    the project team. When you provide structure and create a mindset for continuous feedback and improvement, changes are
    accommodated more easily. In addition, feedback is captured early and often, and high-priority risks are confronted
    early in the project. By constantly identifying and attacking risks, there is more confidence in project progress and
    quality.
</p>
<p>
    Not only does the product evolve, but the team also finds better ways to work together and get involved with
    stakeholders. The process followed by the team can be adjusted accordingly to leverage lessons learned and adjust
    project pace and needs.
</p>
<h3>
    Practices
</h3>
<h4>
    Develop your project in iterations
</h4>
<p>
    Developing a system in a single, linear pass is difficult, because it makes it expensive to incorporate changes and new
    knowledge. Worse, it can delay the discovery and mitigation of risks, because development efforts are scheduled later
    in the lifecycle.
</p>
<p>
    Divide your project into a series of time-boxed <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../core.mgmt.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/iteration_C20B1904.html" guid="_lam4ADkBEduxovfWMDsntw">iterations</a>, and plan your project iteratively. This iterative strategy enables you
    to incrementally deliver capabilities (such as an executable, usable subset of implemented and tested requirements)
    that can be assessed by stakeholders at the end of each iteration. This provides rapid and timely feedback loops, so
    that issues can be addressed and improvements made at a lower cost. Also, this is accomplished while you still have
    sufficient budget and time left to do so, and you have not gone so far ahead that major rework is required.
</p>
<p>
    Iterative development enables teams to continuously improve software throughout the development <a class="elementLinkwithusertext" href="./../../../process.openup.base/deliveryprocesses/openup_lifecycle_EE511F3A.html" guid="_SuWj4dOPEdyqlogshP8l4g">lifecycle</a>.
</p>
<h4>
    Focus iterations on meeting the next management milestone
</h4>
<p>
    A project can appear to make progress while risks and unresolved issues pile up. Focus on bringing closure to important
    project issues (such as stakeholder concurrence regarding scope, and proving the proposed architecture).
</p>
<p>
    Divide the project into phases (such as <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../practice.mgmt.risk_value_lifecycle.base/guidances/concepts/inception_phase_C4456871.html" guid="_0hmKgBOMEduCNqgZdt_OaA">Inception</a>, <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../practice.mgmt.risk_value_lifecycle.base/guidances/concepts/elaboration_phase_BE880435.html" guid="_2plxwBOMEduCNqgZdt_OaA">Elaboration</a>, <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../practice.mgmt.risk_value_lifecycle.base/guidances/concepts/construction_phase_873B6559.html" guid="_48EKsBOMEduCNqgZdt_OaA">Construction</a> and <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../practice.mgmt.risk_value_lifecycle.base/guidances/concepts/transition_phase_DD5986E5.html" guid="__ca5UBOMEduCNqgZdt_OaA">Transition</a>), with each phase having a clearly visible management <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../practice.mgmt.risk_value_lifecycle.base/guidances/concepts/phase_milestones_5678231E.html" guid="_HNxbwMBJEdqSgKaj2SZBmg">milestone</a>. The focus of each iteration within a phase is on achieving that
    milestone.
</p>
<h4>
    Manage risks
</h4>
<p>
    Deferring difficult and risky issues until later in a project significantly increases the risk of project failure. Such
    procrastination may lead to investing in the wrong technologies, a bad design, or a set of requirements that may not
    address stakeholder needs.
</p>
<p>
    Attack <a href="./../../../core.mgmt.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/risk_AF5840DA.html" guid="_0bsLgMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">risks</a> early, or they will attack you. Continuously identify and prioritize risks,
    and then devise strategies to mitigate them. Determine the focus of iterations based on risks. For example,
    architecturally significant risks should be addressed early in the project, no later than the end of the Elaboration
    phase, when the architecture has been proven and baselined.
</p>
<p>
    Fore more information, see <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../core.mgmt.common.extend_supp/guidances/guidelines/managing_risks_B1256EB4.html" guid="_VNxL4ACsEdu8m4dIntu6jA">Guideline: Managing Risks</a>.
</p>
<h4>
    Embrace and manage change
</h4>
<p>
    Change is inevitable, and while change presents opportunities to enhance stakeholder value, unconstrained change will
    result in a bloated, deficient system and unmet stakeholder needs. Furthermore, the later in the development cycle a
    change is made, the more the change is likely to cost.
</p>
<p>
    Embrace and manage change. Embracing change helps you to build a system that addresses stakeholder needs, and managing
    change allows you to reduce costs and improve predictability of those changes. Changes made early in the project can
    usually be made with limited cost. As you progress in your project, changes can become increasingly costly.
</p>
<p>
    To satisfy customer needs, you typically need to introduce changes to the project, but the customer must be made aware
    of the impact that those changes have on the project cost and schedule. Understand the impact of a change in the
    current phase, and isolate team members from disruptive changes during the current iteration. Change requests are
    reviewed and prioritized during the current iteration, but are not acted upon until assigned to a future iteration.
</p>
<p>
    If necessary, document the changes. For informal projects, a discussion with stakeholders may be enough.
</p>
<h4>
    Measure progress objectively
</h4>
<p>
    If you do not objectively know how your project is progressing, you do not really know if it is failing or succeeding.
    Uncertainty and change make a software project's progress difficult to measure objectively, and people are prone to
    making objective assessments from subjective information.
</p>
<p>
    Get a clear picture of project status by objectively measuring progress. The best measure of progress is the delivery
    of working software, which is something that you do by taking an evolutionary approach. You can also define a set of
    objective <a href="./../../../core.mgmt.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/metrics_37698708.html" guid="_0mYYkMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">metrics</a> to collect during an iteration (for example, requirements that were
    implemented and validated, number of defects issued compared with number fixed) and review them as part of the <a href="./../../../practice.mgmt.iterative_dev.base/tasks/assess_results_EC34D88D.html" guid="_0l53cMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">iteration assessment</a>.
</p>
<h4>
    Continuously re-evaluate what you do
</h4>
<p>
    On a regular basis, ask questions and verify assumptions about the project. Regularly meet with the team to track
    status and identify risks and issues. This can be done daily when the team gathers to share the status of individual
    responsibilities and identify and address issues. At the end of iterations, <a href="./../../../practice.mgmt.iterative_dev.base/tasks/assess_results_EC34D88D.html" guid="_0l53cMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">assess the status</a> of what has been done and look for areas of improvement that can
    be addressed in the next iteration. Have a retrospective review at the end of the project and capture lessons learned
    to run future projects in a more efficient way.
</p>
<p>
    If we always challenge what we do and seek new, innovative ways to develop software, we improve how we work. This leads
    to improved project results.

          <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h3>
    Introduction
</h3>
<p>
    The architecture of a software system is the organization or structure of the system's significant components
    interacting through interfaces, with components composed of successively smaller components and interfaces.
</p>
<p>
    Without an architectural foundation, a system will evolve in an inefficient and haphazard way. Such a system often
    proves difficult to extend, reuse, or integrate without substantial rework. It is also difficult to organize the team,
    or to communicate ideas without the <b>common technical focus</b> that the architecture provides.
</p>
<p>
    Focus on the architecture early to minimize risks and organize development.
</p>
<h3>
    Practices
</h3>
<h4>
    Create the architecture for what you know today
</h4>
<p>
    As Albert Einstein said, make everything as simple as possible, but no simpler. Software projects are
    resource-constrained, and the desire of developers to create elegant solutions may lead to a system of greater
    complexity than the stakeholder requires. Efforts to future-proof a system in a turbulent or uncertain environment will
    likely lead to code bloat, which increases overall costs and complexity with few real benefits.
</p>
<p>
    Create architectures that address the stakeholder's real needs, and provide appropriate flexibility and speed for the
    requirements as they are known today. Avoid the desire, no matter how well-intentioned, to speculate on future
    requirements and thereby over-engineer the architecture. There is a distinction between over-architecting and building
    an architecture that is flexible and extensible. For example, there may not be an apparent reason for creating three
    architectural layers in a system, but it is probable that the system will grow in ways one can't predict, so we should
    architect for that.
</p>
<h4>
    Leverage the architecture as a collaborative tool
</h4>
<p>
    Lack of a common understanding by developers about a system leads to indecision and contrary opinions among developers,
    and can quickly paralyze the project. Developers may have different mental models of the system and work at cross
    purposes to each other.
</p>
<p>
    Create and evolve the system architecture with the intention of using it to align the developers' competing mental
    models of the system. A good architecture facilitates collaboration by providing a common vocabulary for all
    discussions regarding the system under development.
</p>
<h4>
    Cope with complexity by raising the level of abstraction
</h4>
<p>
    Software is complex, and people have a limited capacity for coping with complexity. As a system gets larger, it is
    difficult for the team to develop a common understanding of the system, because it's hard to see the bigger picture.
</p>
<p>
    Use models to raise the level of abstraction to focus on important high-level decisions, such as relationships and
    patterns, rather than getting bogged down in details. Modeling raises the level of abstraction, and allows the system
    to be more easily understood from different perspectives.
</p>
<h4>
    Organize the architecture into loosely coupled, highly cohesive components
</h4>
<p>
    Tight coupling between components makes a system fragile and difficult to understand. Software is expensive to create,
    so if existing components can be reused, that may reduce effort required to create a system.
</p>
<p>
    Organize the architecture of the system into components to maximize cohesion and minimize coupling. This improves
    comprehension, and increases flexibility and opportunities for re-use.
</p>
<h4>
    Reuse existing assets
</h4>
<p>
    It is wasteful to build what you can simply reuse, download, or even buy.
</p>
<p>
    Make every effort to reuse existing assets. Developers are often reluctant to reuse assets, because those assets do not
    exactly meet their needs, or those assets are of poor quality. Be prepared to balance the savings you can realize using
    an existing asset, even if the asset requires you to make some accommodation in the architecture or relax a constraint.

    <em>OpenUP layers: micro-increments, iteration lifecycle and project lifecycle</em>
</p>
<p>
    Personal effort on an OpenUP project is organized in <strong>micro-increments</strong>. These represent short units of
    work that produce a steady, measurable pace of project progress (typically measured in hours or a few days). The
    process applies intensive collaboration as the system is incrementally developed by a committed, self-organized team.
    These micro-increments provide an extremely short feedback loop that drives adaptive decisions within each iteration.
</p>
<p>
    OpenUP divides the project into iterations: planned, time-boxed intervals typically measured in weeks. Iterations focus
    the team on delivering incremental value to stakeholders in a predictable manner. The iteration plan defines what
    should be delivered within the iteration, and the result is a demo-able or shippable build. OpenUP teams self-organize
    around how to accomplish iteration objectives and commit to delivering the results. They do that by defining and
    "pulling" fine-grained tasks from a work items list. OpenUP applies an <strong>iteration lifecycle</strong> that
    structures how micro-increments are applied to deliver stable, cohesive builds of the system that incrementally
    progresses towards the iteration objectives.
</p>
<p>
    OpenUP structures the <strong>project lifecycle</strong> into four phases: Inception, Elaboration, Construction, and
    Transition. The project lifecycle provides stakeholders and team members with visibility and decision points throughout
    the project. This enables effective oversight, and allows you to make "go or no-go" decisions at appropriate times. A
    project plan defines the lifecycle, and the end result is a released application.

            <MainDescription><![CDATA[<p>
    Development team members sometimes take documentation for granted, or do not give it enough consideration. However,
    after a product is delivered, customers who pay for the system and for support often do not have enough information to
    effectively manage the product.
</p>
<p>
    If a technical writer is made available to a development team, that role often takes the burden off the team for
    developing the formal product documentation and for ensuring that it is in the correct format and business language. If
    a technical writer is not available, the development team and product owner must make every effort to create enough
    documentation to ensure that the features that have been developed for each release are understood and can be
    communicated effectively by the paying customer to their stakeholders.
</p>
<p>
    Delivering a professionally developed product requires that a development team provide the customer with accurate,
    detailed, and comprehensive product documentation.

            <MainDescription><![CDATA[<p>
    Support documentation often is the most overlooked aspect of a documentation effort. Anyone who has had the opportunity
    to provide end user support for a particular application can appreciate how important effective, well-written support
    documentation can be. This documentation very often is technical in nature and differs significantly from user or
    product documentation, which normally is written for the lay person.
</p>
<p>
    The development team should do its best to make sure that personnel who perform an IT support role have the right
    amount and the relevant type of information necessary to support the application, whether they provide Tier 1, Tier 2,
    or Tier 3 support. Support documentation often is developed based on these three different support categories. How
    effectively the code base is commented and the ease with which those comments are found and understood contributes to
    the quality and quantity of support documentation.

              <Description>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This step is often challenging for development teams because they must put themselves in the position of IT support&#xD;
    personnel to develop the right kind and right amount of useful content. It is advantageous to visit the support&#xD;
    organization and ask them what types of documentation they would want delivered to them at each Release. You might be&#xD;
    surprised at what they say, and it could make your documentation tasks easier if you know exactly what type of&#xD;
    information they want.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Because every product is different, and because each program or IT support organization has unique needs, it is&#xD;
    impossible to list recommended contents for support documentation. However, each program should create support&#xD;
    documentation standards for the development teams that support its program.&#xD;

    Support documentation usually is developed for the three common tiers of a support organization. Tier 1 typically is
    the Help Desk where users call when they have a problem with a particular system. Tier 1 support personnel normally
    answer basic questions and, if necessary, log a ticket and escalate it to the appropriate Level 2 support desk.
</p>
<p>
    Tier 2 support personnel may deal with more complex questions or issues regarding an application and might need to do
    some research on the characteristics of the system to provide an answer. If that person cannot resolve the issue, the
    ticket is escalated to Tier 3 support personnel who have a deeper understanding of the application's code and the
    technology that supports the system's architecture.
</p>
<p>
    To properly convey the necessary information to each support tier, the application's code base should be well commented
    and logically organized. This approach will facilitate the development of the support documentation.
</p>
<p>
    Support documentation typically includes:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        User manuals with work instructions, process descriptions, and procedures
    </li>
    <li>
        Communications, training, and knowledge transfer deliverables

    Having the correct amount and type of materials available to adequately train end users and supporters of an
    application is necessary to promote usability and to achieve the desired business value. If a course ceveloper is

    release. Depending on the contents of the release, more or fewer training materials might be needed to support both end&#xD;
    users and IT operations support personnel.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Training materials generally consist of a combination of:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Presentation slides&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Handouts&#xD;

    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Training aids&#xD;

        Hands-on labs and/or exercises&#xD;

    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Quizzes or tests&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Practical application workshops&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Training materials often are grouped into modules, each with a set of learning objectives and competency assessments.&#xD;

    Because a release ultimately will have to be supported by Help Desk or other technical personnel, a set of training
    materials designed to convey key concepts to those individuals must be developed and delivered by the&nbsp;development

    Delivery of this training might include presentation slides, job aids, lab exercises, or workshops designed to provide

          <MainDescription><![CDATA[<p>
    In almost every case, a product under development needs some amount of documentation for use by those who use its
    features and those who are responsible for keeping the system functioning and available. Because neither of these areas
    are strengths of the software development community, two new roles have been introduced that take advantage of the
    experience and expertise of niche support staff often found in or around an IT organization.
</p>
<p>
    By playing to the strengths and availability of Technical Writers, Course Developers,&nbsp;and Trainers, a Development
    Team does not need to worry about who will write the user documents and train end users - in this case, they can have
    the specialists accept those responsibilities. Also, working with these two specialists ultimately will improve the
    development team's ability to articulate details of the system that they are building and provide insight into subtle
    ways to better comment and document their code.
</p>
<p>
    Virtually all applications that are developed will be used or supported by people. Very often, however, both the
    documentation and training aspects of systems implementation are overlooked or not given enough emphasis. Inattention
    to these areas can result in a product that does not achieve its full business value because the people who should
    benefit from the application are not fully informed or trained.
</p>
<p>
    Although this practice is documented and adopted at the development team level, in some organizations it may be
    advantageous to consolidate and integrate all types of documentation and training materials at the program level and
    deliver one comprehensive package to stakeholders, end users, and IT operations support personnel for the entire
    release across the program.
</p>]]></MainDescription>
          <KeyConsiderations></KeyConsiderations>
          <AdditionalInfo></AdditionalInfo>
          <Application>&lt;p>&#xD;
    With this practice, basic guidance regarding &lt;em>how&lt;/em> to develop documentation and training, and more importantly&#xD;
    &lt;em>why&lt;/em>, are provided here. The best way to read this practice is to become familiar with its overall structure,&#xD;
    what is in it, and how it is organized.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There are two related parts to this practice: 1) Documentation, and 2) Training. The documentation activity normally&#xD;
    feeds the training effort. There are three basic types of documentation, each of which is meant for a different&#xD;
    audience, and each has its own purpose.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Product&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        User&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Support&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A combination of the Product Documentation and User Documentation, with User Stories and Nonfunctional Requirements,&#xD;
    are used in the development of User Training.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Product Documentation, with the Architecture Notebook and any design artifacts, are used to create Support&#xD;
    Documentation.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Start with the tasks for creating the different types of documentation. Then, review the work products that result from&#xD;
    those tasks. Next, review the tasks of the training activity. Notice that there is only one task that produces two&#xD;
    different types of training materials (end user and support materials), because the process is the same for both&#xD;
    (unlike the process for developing the three types of documentation). There are two tasks for training delivery because&#xD;
    the end user training often is formal in nature and support training usually is informal.&#xD;

    The purpose of this practice is to harden the product before a release by documenting key aspects for use by multiple&#xD;
    audiences and by providing training to end users who will take delivery of the product when it is released.&#xD;

    information about the product (in comprehensive documentation) and have been adequately trained regarding how to use
    the product.
</p>
<h3>
    Common pitfalls
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Inadequate documentation:</strong> No one likes to rigorously document a product, least of all the team
        members who developed it. Historically, product documentation often has been an afterthought, if given thought at
        all. In the Agile world, because the goal is to deliver high quality, working software to end users more quickly,
        realize that part of the quality component is adequate documentation that enables end users to use the product more
        effectively.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Non-existent or inadequate training:</strong> Like documentation, training often is an afterthought. When
        product budgets are reduced, training often is the first line item to be eliminated. However, in fairness to the
        end user community, proper training about how to use the product is critical to the overall success of product
        deployment in terms of enabling end users do their jobs effectively.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Considerations
</h3>
<p>
    The following is a list of points to consider when adopting this practice:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Training depends on documentation:</strong> The better the documentation, the easier it is to develop
        training materials. If your team skimps on the quality and quantity of product documentation, the cost of training
        materials development will significantly increase.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Documentation can be developed in many ways:</strong> The more varied the documentation media (e.g., Help
        files, Wizards, PowerPoint presentations, video vignettes, etc.), the easier it will be to use those forms of
        documentation and convert them into robust training modules. Also, multiple forms of documentation will appeal to a
        broader audience because people internalize information differently: what works for one person might not resonate
        with another.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Training can be delivered in many ways:</strong> Like documentation, training delivery media should be
        varied to appeal to different audiences. Not only can training be delivered by a live instructor in a classroom,
        other options include:
    </li>
    <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
        <ul>
            <li>
                Computer-based training where users complete modules on their own time
            </li>
            <li>
                On-line instructor-led modules delivered over the Internet at scheduled times
            </li>
            <li>
                Just-in-time training modules (either live or on-line instructor-led) for incremental learning
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>]]></MainDescription>

    A release package cannot be deployed to production if the environmental infrastructure within which the release will be
    run is not sufficiently built or tested. Whether the release is deployed as a "push" (where the application is deployed
    from a central point and proactively delivered to target locations) or a "pull" (where the application is made
    available at central point and pulled by a user at a time of their choosing), the infrastructure needed to support the
    application must be considered and implemented.
</p>
<p>
    Some key aspects of installing and/or validating the desired infrastructure:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Identify the requirements and components of the environment configuration

    <li>
        Determine the lead times required to establish the infrastructure environments
    </li>
    <li>
        Procure and install the infrastructure components that are not yet available
    </li>
    <li>
        Test the newly installed infrastructure components
    </li>
    <li>
        Test the integration of newly installed components with the rest of the environmental configuration
    </li>
    <li>
        Validate other aspects of the infrastructure including: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Security components and their integration
            </li>

    Release controls describe the minimum number of requirements that a software package must adhere to before being
    released into production. This is especially important if a development team is new or emerging, because they might not
    be aware of the great responsibilities a deployment manager has. In fact, a deployment manager is responsible to senior
    management for ensuring that nothing is placed into production that does not conform to the rigid controls designed to
    protect the IT organization's ability to successfully deliver IT services to internal and external customers.
</p>
<p>
    Release controls typically consist of the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Release or deployment plan
    </li>
    <li>
        Backout plan

    When a release is pushed to production, all the stakeholders of that product should be notified that the event has
    happened and what the release means to each of the stakeholders. Often, the output of this task does not need to be
    created from scratch; for products that plan multiple releases, just updating the communique details for each release
    might be enough. However, if any of the stakeholder groups change, or there is a significant difference in the product
    distribution, more significant content might need to be developed.
</p>
<p>
    In any case, communicating effectively to the end user community is important. A development team can develop high
    quality software, but if messaging to the stakeholders is conducted poorly or not at all, the end user experience might
    be degraded. By simply answering the questions "who, what, when, where, why, and how" in a format appropriate for each
    stakeholder group, a product release can become a more satisfying experience for all those involved.

    Some common release controls are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        A release or deployment plan must be documented and reviewed with the Deployment Manager (or the release

        timeframe leading up to the actual release
    </li>
    <li>
        The components of each release package must be defined, integrated, and compatible with one another

    <li>
        The integrity of each release package must be verified and maintained

    <li>
        Each release package must be capable of being backed out of production without negatively impacting the remaining

    The deployment plan should contain the unique instructions for deploying a particular version of a product. By "unique
    instructions" we mean those things that are not part of a deployment engineer's normal procedures. Rather, they often

    particular release.

    Sometimes, depending on the product user base, separate communiques might need to be prepared for each stakeholder
    group. In that case, this artifact should specify the different groups to which communications are directed, the method
    of communication (e.g., email, text or pager message, bulletin, newsletter, phone message, etc.). All communiques
    should be prepared in advance so that it is a matter of disseminating information when the release to production has
    been determined to be successful.
</p>
<p>
    Also included in this artifact is a listing of the responsible parties who will execute the communications when a

    While there is no prescribed format for the release communications artifact, each communique should indicate the
    preferred delivery mechanisms (for example: beeper notification, telephone calls, a posting to an internal release
    website, live or pre-recorded presentations by senior management, etc.). This artifact generally answers the following
    questions:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Who are the parties (stakeholders) that are interested in knowing that a release to production has taken place?

            <MainDescription><![CDATA[<p>
    A release consists of integrated, compiled code that runs cleanly, independently, and in its entirety. This is an
    important rule because in order to be released or even "potentially shippable," a release increment must be able to
    stand on its own, otherwise it is not shippable. Releases&nbsp;can be created at either the program or team level.
</p>
<p>
    There are three potential uses for a release:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>It is not used outside of the program:</strong> It has been produced to minimize risks linked to technology
        and a program's capability to integrate components and to produce a Build. This situation usually happens at the
        beginning of a new product lifecycle.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>It is used by beta customers and the program manager:</strong> It allows end users to test it in a Beta
        test environment, which provides immediate feedback and reduces risks associated with user interface ergonomics.
        customer feedback will influence the program backlog for later consideration.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>It is deployed or shipped and used by end users:</strong> This result provides immediate value to the end
        users.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    In many organizations, a program release typically is timeboxed to 2 to 3 months of development effort and 2 to 4 weeks
    of hardening which results in a scheduled release approximately every 90 days. Releases for individual development
    teams usually occur more often than those for programs, but there are no hard and fast rules regarding how often
    releases should be scheduled. The only requirement is that working software should be delivered "frequently" by both
    development teams and programs. Although the example timeframe described above is arbitrary, empirical evidence
    suggests it is about right for most companies and fits nicely into quarterly planning cycles.
</p>
<p>
    Each release has a set of release objectives and a projected delivery date; it also has a planned number of
    sprint/iterations. For example, a brief description of a release might be: "The goal of Release 2 is to provide B2B
    scheduling capability for the Ordering and Logistics Department. The release is targeted for June 31 and will consist
    of five 2-week feature development sprint/iterations and&nbsp;one 2-week release sprint/iteration."

    This task is straightforward: follow the procedures in the Deployment Plan for the rollout of a specific product
    release. If the deployment plan does not exist or it is poorly constructed, this task might be much more difficult.
</p>
<p>
    The main point here is that to achieve a high probability of success, the development team should have previously
    developed a detailed plan that organizes and articulates all the unique instructions for deploying that particular
    release. Because an experienced deployment engineer normally executes this task, they might be able to overcome any
    missing deployment procedures or content. However, that is not an excuse for a development team to not develop the
    plan's contents.

    Mike Cohn, noted author on Scrum, states:
</p>
<blockquote style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" dir="ltr">
    <p class="quote">
        ..."Some large or complex projects will require the use of "release Sprint/Iteration" or "hardening
        Sprint/Iteration" at the end of a release cycle (say 6 two-week Sprint/Iterations then a 2-week release
        Sprint/Iteration). The release Sprint/Iteration is not a dumping ground for sloppy work; rather it is a place where
        some hardening of the system can occur."
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">
    There are two components of the Production Release practice: 1) Release Preparation, and 2) Deployment. Release
    preparation establishes a release baseline and produces all the necessary supporting material necessary to deploy (and
    back out, if necessary) the release.
</p>
<p>
    Deployment involves the act of delivering the release into the production environment, verifying that the integration
    of the release package into the existing environment was successful, and notifying all relevant stakeholders that the
    features of the release are available for use.
</p>
<p>
    Unfortunately, there is little guidance available today regarding the practice of releasing to production. Although
    there is wealth of information documented in the Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) set of process
    books on this topic, those reference materials are used primarily by members of Production Support and IT Operations
    organizations and not application development groups.
</p>
<p>
    This practice is designed to fill some of the void in this area for product development teams.

    Start with the tasks for preparing the release for production, then review the work products that result from those&#xD;
    tasks. Next, review the tasks of the deployment activity. Although these tasks sound straightforward, there is much&#xD;

    Releasing a finished or emerging product into production is no trivial matter. Sometimes, business operations are&#xD;
    interrupted or shut down because a release has somehow corrupted the production environment. Because the release&#xD;
    activity can have such a dramatic impact on the business, the purpose of the Production Release practice is to ensure&#xD;
    that the application developed is properly prepared to be released into production without any unintended consequences.&#xD;

          <MainDescription><![CDATA[<h3>
    Getting started with this practice
</h3>
<p>
    The goal of the Production Release practice is to transform the business value developed in Feature Development
    Sprint/Iterations into a finished product that can be released into production along with other products as part of a
    coordinated Release.
</p>
<p>
    If a development team has never practiced Production Release before, the best way to think of this special type of
    Sprint/Iteration is to consider a past project in which your team spent a week of 16-hour days doing all the things
    necessary to prepare for a deployment based on an arbitrary release date. Then realize that you do not have to operate
    like that any more, and that a Production Release Sprint/Iteration is your opportunity to calmly deal with all the
    preparatory activities that accompany a well-managed, coordinated release while other development team members are
    doing the same. In short, the Production Release practice represents the way you always wished you could prepare for a
    release but did not have the opportunity.
</p>
<h3>
    Common pitfalls
</h3>
<p>
    Because production release provides a development team the opportunity to "fine tune" a product and tighten up
    problematic areas of the code, it is good practice not to squander that Sprint/Iteration.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>A Release Sprint/Iteration is not a time to rest:</strong> Some development team members think that when
        they get to Production Release they can relax and not work too hard. However, when practicing the Agile value of
        Sustainable Pace, teams should <em>not need to</em> rest, and team members should maintain the tempo that they
        established during previous Feature Development Sprint/Iterations.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Testing is not more important than documentation and training:</strong> While the various types of testing
        that are conducted in a Release Sprint/Iteration (integration, system, UAT) are important, documentation and
        training are just as important because how well end users can actually use the product to do their work is critical
        to a successful delivery.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Successful hardening is more important than squeezing in marginally tested features:</strong> Do not think
        that more features delivered is necessarily better. While there is always a temptation to deliver more
        functionality in a Release, resist that desire and deliver only features that are mature and have been well tested
        and integrated.
    </li>
</ul>]]></MainDescription>

    Typical activities that occur during a Release Sprint/Iteration include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Removing accrued technical debt
    </li>
    <li>
        Fixing critical and major defects
    </li>
    <li>
        Finalizing integrations to other systems
    </li>
    <li>
        Documenting various aspects of the product, including support and user documentation
    </li>
    <li>
        Significant functional, performance, load, system,&nbsp;user acceptance, and integration testing
    </li>
    <li>
        Training support personnel and end users
    </li>
    <li>
        Drafting an Implementation Plan and/or Deployment Plan
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Sometimes development teams will split into two - one subteam works on release hardening activities, while the other
    works in parallel using a separate stream, developing new features for a follow-on release.
