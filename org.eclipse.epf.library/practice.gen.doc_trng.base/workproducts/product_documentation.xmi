  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Product documentation is created for the benefit of the marketing arm of an organization, the program manager, and&#xD;
    those people who must assess the business value of a particular system.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This is an often overlooked aspect of development team implementation. The team should consider that the customers of a&#xD;
    particular release usually are not technical themselves, but do require a detailed enough understanding of how their&#xD;
    product operates and how it meets stated business goals and needs.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>
  <purpose>The purpose of this work product is to provide documentation about the product for a product owner and their constituents&#xD;
to be able to manage the product during its development and after the project is completed.</purpose>
