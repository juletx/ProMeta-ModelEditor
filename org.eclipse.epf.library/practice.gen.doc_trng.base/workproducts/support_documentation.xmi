  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Support documentation usually is developed for the three common tiers of a support organization. Tier 1 typically is&#xD;
    the Help Desk where users call when they have a problem with a particular system. Tier 1 support personnel normally&#xD;
    answer basic questions and, if necessary, log a ticket and escalate it to the appropriate Level 2 support desk.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Tier 2 support personnel may deal with more complex questions or issues regarding an application and might need to do&#xD;
    some research on the characteristics of the system to provide an answer. If that person cannot resolve the issue, the&#xD;
    ticket is escalated to Tier 3 support personnel who have a deeper understanding of the application's code and the&#xD;
    technology that supports the system's architecture.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    To properly convey the necessary information to each support tier, the application's code base should be well commented&#xD;
    and logically organized. This approach will facilitate the development of the support documentation.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Support documentation typically includes:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        User manuals with work instructions, process descriptions, and procedures&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Communications, training, and knowledge transfer deliverables&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Support and operations manuals&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Service information, including Help Desk scripts&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></mainDescription>
  <purpose>The purpose of this work product is to convey to the different levels of a support organization (Tiers 1, 2, and 3) enough&#xD;
information so they can effectively support the application.</purpose>
