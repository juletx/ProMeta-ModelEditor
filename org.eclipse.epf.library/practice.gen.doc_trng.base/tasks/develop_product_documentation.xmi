  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Development team members sometimes take documentation for granted, or do not give it enough consideration. However,&#xD;
    after a product is delivered, customers who pay for the system and for support often do not have enough information to&#xD;
    effectively manage the product.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If a technical writer is made available to a development team, that role often takes the burden off the team for&#xD;
    developing the formal product documentation and for ensuring that it is in the correct format and business language. If&#xD;
    a technical writer is not available, the development team and product owner must make every effort to create enough&#xD;
    documentation to ensure that the features that have been developed for each release are understood and can be&#xD;
    communicated effectively by the paying customer to their stakeholders.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Delivering a professionally developed product requires that a development team provide the customer with accurate,&#xD;
    detailed, and comprehensive product documentation.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Every release will contain a set of features that were developed during the preceding feature development sprint or&#xD;
    iterations. This list should drive the table of contents of the product documentation. It also is possible that some&#xD;
    nonfunctional requirements should be documented as well.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    While the product documentation will not be used directly as user documentation, it will become the basis for the user&#xD;
    documentation. That foundation of information is why this step is important.&#xD;
