  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Having the correct amount and type of materials available to adequately train end users and supporters of an&#xD;
    application is necessary to promote usability and to achieve the desired business value. If a course ceveloper is&#xD;
    available, they can assume most of the burden of creating the training materials, lab exercises, and workshops&amp;nbsp;for&#xD;
    delivery of&amp;nbsp;those courses to either end users or support personnel. If a course developer is not&#xD;
    available,&amp;nbsp;development team members should take the time to properly develop a suite of training materials for the&#xD;
    feature set developed during a release.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Although different parts of training materials should be created during feature development sprint/iterations, the bulk&#xD;
    of the work (and the integration of the materials) usually is reserved for the release sprint/iteration that occurs&#xD;
    immediately before a scheduled release.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Consult the program manager and deployment manager to determine the extent of training materials required for this&#xD;
    release. Depending on the contents of the release, more or fewer training materials might be needed to support both end&#xD;
    users and IT operations support personnel.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Training materials generally consist of a combination of:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Presentation slides&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Handouts&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Training aids&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Hands-on labs and/or exercises&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Quizzes or tests&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Practical application workshops&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Training materials often are grouped into modules, each with a set of learning objectives and competency assessments.&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Leverage all the user documentation that has been prepared previously or is in the process of being prepared. The table&#xD;
    of contents of the user documentation will provide a starting point for developing a training course framework and a&#xD;
    lesson plan.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    First identify the learning objectives of each training module, then reuse as much user documentation as is possible.&#xD;
    If tutorials were documented within either user or support documentation, they are a good source of content for&#xD;
    training modules.&#xD;

  <sections xmi:id="_-zenmuB8EeC1y_NExchKwQ" name="Develop support training materials" guid="_-zenmuB8EeC1y_NExchKwQ">
    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    In many cases, IT support personnel are experienced enough to require minimal training on a product release. However,&#xD;
    where the product is new to the support organization, or the support personnel themselves are inexperienced or&#xD;
    unfamiliar with a particular technology, support training becomes very important to the success of the product rollout.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Using the support documentation as a guideline, identify the parts of the product on which IT support personnel will&#xD;
    need to be trained. Identify training modules and document learning objectives for each module, then leverage as much&#xD;
    of the support documentation content as you can to create your training materials.&#xD;
