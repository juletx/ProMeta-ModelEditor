    Often, a trainer will deliver training to end users; rarely will the development team deliver training because they are&#xD;
    busy developing additional features for this or other systems. If a trainer is not available, the product owner might&#xD;
    have to train the end users.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    End user training usually consists of presentation slides, job aids, hands-on labs and exercises, or workshops that&#xD;
    integrate these methods into an environment that the end users can understand and relate to.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>

    Before actually delivering the training to end users, ensure that you have all the necessary components of the training&#xD;
    course, including:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Presentation slides&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Handouts&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Training aids&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Hands-on labs and/or exercises&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Quizzes or tests&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Feedback and/or instructor assessment forms&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Ensure the classes have been scheduled correctly and attendees have been identified. Verify that the facilities where&#xD;
    you will deliver the training have been properly booked and are furnished to accommodate the training content and&#xD;
    audience. If possible, send a reminder notice to the attendees several days (or a week) before the delivery date.&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>Review the training materials so that you are familiar with them. If you encounter any areas in which you are unsure or&#xD;
tentative about, engage experts from the development team or program who can help you understand the material. Then, update&#xD;
the training materials accordingly and create instructor notes to help you remember key points as you deliver the training.&#xD;
Instructor notes that you author will not only help you, but they might assist other instructors in the future who have not&#xD;
had the benefit of working with the development team or program.</sectionDescription>
