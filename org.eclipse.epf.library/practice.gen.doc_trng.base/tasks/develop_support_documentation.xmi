  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Support documentation often is the most overlooked aspect of a documentation effort. Anyone who has had the opportunity&#xD;
    to provide end user support for a particular application can appreciate how important effective, well-written support&#xD;
    documentation can be. This documentation very often is technical in nature and differs significantly from user or&#xD;
    product documentation, which normally is written for the lay person.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The development team should do its best to make sure that personnel who perform an IT support role have the right&#xD;
    amount and the relevant type of information necessary to support the application, whether they provide Tier 1, Tier 2,&#xD;
    or Tier 3 support. Support documentation often is developed based on these three different support categories. How&#xD;
    effectively the code base is commented and the ease with which those comments are found and understood contributes to&#xD;
    the quality and quantity of support documentation.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This step is often challenging for development teams because they must put themselves in the position of IT support&#xD;
    personnel to develop the right kind and right amount of useful content. It is advantageous to visit the support&#xD;
    organization and ask them what types of documentation they would want delivered to them at each Release. You might be&#xD;
    surprised at what they say, and it could make your documentation tasks easier if you know exactly what type of&#xD;
    information they want.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Because every product is different, and because each program or IT support organization has unique needs, it is&#xD;
    impossible to list recommended contents for support documentation. However, each program should create support&#xD;
    documentation standards for the development teams that support its program.&#xD;

    Use the development team's Release Plan as a mechanism to define the scope of the support documentation. Source&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>Based on the previous steps, write the support documentation. One way to do this is to assign sections of the document&#xD;
