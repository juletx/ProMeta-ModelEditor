  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This task is about designing part of the system, not the whole system.&amp;nbsp; It should be applied based upon some small&#xD;
    subset of requirements.&amp;nbsp; The requirements driving the design could be scenario-based functional requirements,&#xD;
    non-functional requirements, or a combination.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This task can be applied in some specific context such as the database access elements required for some&#xD;
    scenario.&amp;nbsp; In this case the task might be applied&amp;nbsp;again later&amp;nbsp;to deal with a different context on the&#xD;
    same requirements.&amp;nbsp; Keep in mind that to actually build some functionality of value&amp;nbsp;to the users, all&#xD;
    contexts will typically need to be designed and implemented. For example, to actually utilize some system capability it&#xD;
    will have to have been designed and implemented all its context such as user interface, business rules, database&#xD;
    access, etc.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For cohesion and completeness, this task is described as an end-to-end pass of designing a scenario of system usage. In&#xD;
    practice, this task will be revisited many times as the design is first considered, portions are implemented, more&#xD;
    design is performed based on what was learned, etc. The healthiest application of this task is in very close proximity&#xD;
    to the implementation.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If this task is being performed on an architecturally significant element the results of this design should be&#xD;
    referenced by the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../core.tech.slot.base/workproducts/technical_architecture_slot_FF074CDD.html&quot;&#xD;

&lt;/p></mainDescription>
  <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Each step in this task can cause all previous steps to be revisited in light of new information and decisions.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    For example, while determining how elements collaborate&amp;nbsp;you might find a gap in the requirements that causes you&#xD;
    to go back to the beginning after collaborating with the analyst, or when evaluating the design a reviewer&#xD;
    could&amp;nbsp;note that a reusable element being used doesn't work as expected and that could cause you to identify new&#xD;
    elements to take its place.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Consider the architecture while performing this task.&amp;nbsp; All design work must be done while regarding the&#xD;
    architecture within which the design exists.&amp;nbsp; Furthermore, certain design elements will be deemed architecturally&#xD;
    significant; those elements will require updates to the architecture.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This task will be applied numerous times.&amp;nbsp; Design is best performed in small chunks.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Even when starting the design for a particular project it&amp;nbsp;is expected that there will be existing frameworks and&#xD;
    reusable elements.&amp;nbsp; Every step of this task must give attention to the existing design and existing&#xD;
    implementation, utilizing existing elements when possible and emulating or improving existing elements as appropriate&#xD;
    while designing this portion of the solution.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Apply patterns throughout this task.&amp;nbsp; Patterns represent proven designs and their usage promotes quality and&#xD;
    consistency across the design.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If the requirements are not represented in some sort of scenario form (for example a non-functional requirement might&#xD;
    not have a scenario associated with it), a scenario will have to be identified that appropriately exercises the&#xD;
    requirements under consideration.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If the requirements are&amp;nbsp;determined to be&amp;nbsp;incomplete or incorrect, work with the analyst to get the&#xD;

    Identify the elements that collaborate together to provide the required behavior. This can start with the key&#xD;
    abstractions identified in the Architecture Notebook, design, domain analysis, and classical analysis of the&#xD;
    requirements (noun filtering) to derive the elements that would be required to fulfill them. The &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;

    Walk through the scenario distributing responsibilities to the participating elements and ensuring that the elements&#xD;
    have the relationships required to collaborate.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    These responsibilities can be simple statements of behavior assigned to elements; they need not be detailed operation&#xD;
    specifications with parameters, etc. Similarly, the relationships can just be defined at this step. This step is about&#xD;
    ensuring that a quality model is being created that is robust enough to support the requirements. See &lt;a&#xD;

    Look to the architecture and previous design work to create a consistent collaboration. Work with the architect to&#xD;

    Refine the design to an appropriate level of detail to drive implementation and to ensure that it fits into the&#xD;
    architecture. In this step the design can take into consideration the actual implementation language and other&#xD;
    technical decisions. Revisit the identification of the elements and the collaborations that realize the scenarios if&#xD;
    necessary as this refinement takes into consideration details at a lower level of abstraction. Discuss testability&#xD;
    issues, such as design elements that are difficult to test or critical performance areas, with the tester and&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Evolve the design by examining recent changes in the larger context of the design and determine if refactoring and&#xD;

    Communicate&amp;nbsp;the system's design to&amp;nbsp;those who need to understand it. Though this is described here toward the&#xD;
    end of the task, communication should be going on throughout the steps. Working collaboratively is always better than&#xD;
    reviewing the work after it is complete.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Here are some ways to communicate&amp;nbsp;the design:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Formal models&amp;nbsp;specified in UML.&#xD;

    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Informal diagrams that render static structure and capture&amp;nbsp;dynamic behavior.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Annotated code that communicates information about the static structure. This can be&amp;nbsp;supplemented with textual&#xD;
        descriptions of collaborative behavior across code modules.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Data models to describe the database schema.&#xD;

        Developers&amp;nbsp;who will implement a solution based on the design.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Architects who can review the design to ensure that it conforms to the architecture or who might examine the design&#xD;
        for opportunities to improve the architecture.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Other designers who can examine the design for applicability to other parts of the system.&#xD;

    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Developers or other designers who will be working on other parts of the system that will&amp;nbsp;depend on the&#xD;
        elements designed in this task.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
