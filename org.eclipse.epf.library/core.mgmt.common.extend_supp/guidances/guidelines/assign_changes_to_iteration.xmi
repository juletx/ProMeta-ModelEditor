  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Most iterative software development processes recommend that changes not be introduced during an iteration. The main&#xD;
    idea is that the iterations should be short and with clearly defined scope so that they can be time-boxed.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    To limit scope within an iteration, change requests are reviewed and prioritized as soon as possible, but are not&#xD;
    assigned for implementation until a future iteration via the work items list.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Since iterations are relatively short this should not cause undue delay in dealing with urgent and important change&#xD;
    requests.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    One notable exception is a defect discovered during testing that prevents the team from meeting the objectives of the&#xD;
    iteration. In this case it is reasonable to assign the work item to the current iteration as this does not represent a&#xD;
    scope change, it represents unfinished work.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Consider the following when choosing the future iteration where the change request will be addressed:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Group similar change requests in the same iteration. For example multiple change requests focused on the same&#xD;
        functionality or that are dependent on each other.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Assign change requests that mitigate high risks to the earliest iteration possible.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></mainDescription>
