    &lt;a id=&quot;1036306&quot; name=&quot;1036306&quot;>Business Analysts (BA) act as the bridge between the business and IT departments,&#xD;
    by smoothing the way as corporate policy moves from definition to execution inside a software application. Business&#xD;
    Analysts must translate policy into a formal specification acceptable to developers, and must validate the formal&#xD;
    specification with policy managers who may not understand the language of the specification.&lt;/a>&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Depending on their level of technical knowledge, Business Analysts may perform tasks that are described as developer&#xD;
    tasks. However, generally business analysts do not write code. &lt;a id=&quot;4942&quot; name=&quot;4942&quot;>In a BRMS a&#xD;
    BA also represents a type of user profile who is responsible for modeling business rule application projects&lt;/a>.&#xD;
