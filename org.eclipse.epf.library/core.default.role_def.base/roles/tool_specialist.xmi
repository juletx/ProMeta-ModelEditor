    An individual playing this role needs to have a broad set of skills. This includes an understanding of the underlying&#xD;
    processes used by the project, and for this training might be required prior to project startup. General systematic&#xD;
    analysis skills are beneficial when comparing and selecting tools for the project. Knowledge of the development&#xD;
    platform(s) is required, on networking issues in particular. A person acting as this role also needs good&#xD;
    communication skills and a 'service-minded' attitude, since she or he is likely to be a support contact point for the&#xD;
    project members, on installation and other tool troubleshooting issues.&#xD;

    This role can be assigned in the following ways:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Assign one or more staff members to perform both this role and developer roles. This is a commonly&#xD;
        adopted approach, especially in small-to-mid-sized teams, and capitalizes on the common development skills&#xD;
        that developer role shares with this role.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Assign one staff member to perform this role only. This is a commonly adopted approach and is particularly suitable&#xD;
        for large teams or smaller teams where effective tool support and process automation is a key aspect of the&#xD;
        projects development plan.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></assignmentApproaches>
