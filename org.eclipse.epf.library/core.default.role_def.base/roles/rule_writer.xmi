policies are ultimately implemented as part of critical business applications as executable rules. Rule&#xD;
Writers are experts in business logic and manage executable business rules within an organization. Rule Writers&#xD;
are responsible for writing and/or enforcing the business policies of a given enterprise.&lt;/a> &lt;a id=&quot;1036296&quot;&#xD;

&lt;p class=&quot;Body&quot;>&#xD;
    In a BRMS rule writers participate in the initial process of extracting business rules from existing policy (documents,&#xD;
    databases, code, SME, etc.). This process, referred to as rule harvesting, is carried out with the business analyst&#xD;
    whose aim is to determine the vocabulary elements that are necessary to be able to write the rules that implement the&#xD;
    policy.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;Body&quot;>&#xD;
    During the rule set development life cycle the Rule Writer will use different authoring environments: he uses&#xD;
    an Integrated Development Environment like Eclipse IDE to develop the structure of the rules set, the&#xD;
    executable flow of rules, the technical rules, and he can test the execution of the rules in this environment.&#xD;
    Once the rule set is mature enough Rule Writer will use a web based BRMS platform. The advantage of the web based for&#xD;
    rule authoring is the ubiquitous access, and the use of wizards to guide the management of the rules and the rule&#xD;
    sets.&#xD;
