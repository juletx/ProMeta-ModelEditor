  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This role is the one and only person responsible for managing the Product Backlog and ensuring the value of the work&#xD;
    the development team performs. The Product Owner has the responsibility of defining what is the right product to build,&#xD;
    determining the order in which features will be built, and making sure that the product actually works. The Product&#xD;
    Owner is responsible for defining the features of the product to be developed by the team in terms of:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Functionality:&lt;/strong> Identifies each product requirement as a Product Backlog Item and supplies&#xD;
        details for those requirements when they are needed by the team, including specifying the acceptance tests for&#xD;
        each requirement&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Priority:&lt;/strong> Defines the order in which those backlog items will be developed, according to the value&#xD;
        that they bring to Customers and users, which provides the team with a Product Backlog ready for Sprint/Iteration&#xD;
        planning&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Goal:&lt;/strong> Defines the release goals and makes decisions concerning release planning&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Product Owner has the following responsibilities:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul class=&quot;noindent&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Define the features of the product&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Decide on release date and content&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Responsible for the profitability of the product (ROI)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Prioritize features according to market value&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Adjust features and priorities as needed&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Accept or reject work results&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This person maintains the Product Backlog and ensures that it is visible to everyone. Everyone understands what items&#xD;
    have the highest priority, so everyone on the development Team knows what will be worked on.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Product Owner is one person, not a committee. Committees may exist that advise or influence this person but team&#xD;
    members who want to change an item's priority must first convince the Product Owner. In this way, organizational&#xD;
    methods for setting priorities and requirements are influenced over time by this role.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For the Product Owner to succeed, everyone in the organization must respect their decisions. No one is allowed to&#xD;
    direct the development team member to work from a different set of priorities. Team members are not allowed to follow the direction&#xD;
    of anyone whose direction does not coincide with the direction provided by the Product Owner. The Product Owner’s&#xD;
    decisions are visible in the content and prioritization of the Product Backlog. This visibility requires that the&#xD;
    Product Owner do their best. Visibility makes the role of Product Owner both a demanding and a rewarding experience.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Product Owner is responsible for the first of the three Scrum ceremonies, Sprint/Iteration Planning. The development team evaluates&#xD;
    the prioritized Product Backlog, identifies the top priority items, and commits to completing the selected items during&#xD;
    a Sprint/Iteration. These items become the basis for the Sprint/Iteration Backlog.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In return for the development team's commitment to completing the selected tasks, the Product Owner commits that they will&#xD;
    not introduce new requirements to the team during the Sprint/Iteration. Requirements are allowed to change but only outside the&#xD;
    Sprint/Iteration. After the team begins a Sprint/Iteration, it remains focused on the goals of that Sprint/Iteration. The only exception to this&#xD;
    rule is that a similar amount of work can be removed from a Sprint/Iteration to accommodate a new requirement.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>
  <keyConsiderations>The Product Owner's commitment is essential to ensure the project success. By defining the product vision, they provide&#xD;
direction to the team. By externally promoting each Sprint/Iteration result, the Product Owner brings recognition and motivation&#xD;
to the team.</keyConsiderations>
  <skills>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The person who plays this role should have the following competencies:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Good knowledge of the business domain&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Demonstrate leadership and be respected by external stakeholders (Customers and users)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Make decisions at the right time (not too soon, not too late)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &quot;Open minded&quot; to changes&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Effective communication skills with the team&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A former Business Analyst or Project Manager is a good candidate for this role.&#xD;
&lt;/p></skills>
  <assignmentApproaches>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Only one person can play this role for each development team. This person must be assigned to the project (the Product&#xD;
    Owner is a member of the development team and should participate in the Daily Stand-up meeting). The workload&#xD;
    associated with this role almost requires a full-time assignment.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Product Owner is:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A single person dedicated to the project who must be available to answer the team's questions promptly to define&#xD;
        feature tests and provide advice regarding various product aspects (the software UI, for example)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        An extended member of the team who participates in Sprint/Iteration planning and Sprint/Iteration review meetings&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Typically someone from a Marketing role or a key user in internal development&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Can be a Customer representative or a Customer proxy&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Suggestions from&amp;nbsp;Ken Schwaber's&amp;nbsp;Scrum Guide:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The Product Owner can be a Team member, and in addition perform development work. This additional responsibility&#xD;
        may affect the Product Owner’s ability to work with stakeholders. However, the Product Owner can never be the&#xD;
        ScrumMaster.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        For commercial development, the Product Owner may be the product manager. For in-house development efforts, the&#xD;
        Product Owner can be the manager of the business function that is being automated.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></assignmentApproaches>
