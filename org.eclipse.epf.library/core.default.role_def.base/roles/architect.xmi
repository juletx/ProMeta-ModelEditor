  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The person in this role leads or coordinates the technical design of the system and has overall responsibility for&#xD;
    facilitating the major technical decisions expressed as software architecture. This typically includes identifying and&#xD;
    documenting the architecturally significant aspects of the system as views that describe requirements, design,&#xD;
    implementation, and deployment.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This role is also responsible for providing the rationale for these decisions, balancing the concerns of the various&#xD;
    stakeholders, reducing technical risks, and ensuring that decisions are effectively communicated, validated, and&#xD;
    followed.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This role works closely with project managers in staffing and planning the project, because it is recommended&#xD;
    that the team be organized around the architecture.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This role also works closely with analysts and developers to make sure that the architecturally significant&#xD;
    requirements are assigned to the proper components of the system. &#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>
  <skills>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Architects must be well-rounded people with maturity, vision, and a depth of experience that allows for grasping issues&#xD;
    quickly and making educated, critical judgments in the absence of complete information. Specifically, the person must&#xD;
    possess this combination of qualifications:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Experience&lt;/b> &lt;strong>in both problem and software engineering domains&lt;/strong>, with evidence of a thorough&#xD;
        understanding of the requirements to solve the problem and active participation in software development. If there&#xD;
        is a team, this experience can be represented by different team members, but at least one person must be able to&#xD;
        describe the overall vision for the project.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Leadership ability&lt;/b> to motivate and maintain momentum for the technical effort across the various teams and&#xD;
        to make critical decisions under pressure, plus make those decisions stick. To be effective, this role must have&#xD;
        the authority to make technical decisions. This role cannot lead by decree, but only by the consent of the rest of&#xD;
        the project team. To be effective, this person must earn the respect of the team members, project managers,&#xD;
        the customer, and the user community, as well as the management team.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Excellent communication&lt;/b> &lt;strong>skills&lt;/strong> to earn trust, persuade, motivate, and mentor. The person in&#xD;
        this role must have good communication skills, both verbally and in writing.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Critical review skills&lt;/b> to make sure that the requirements to be built are clear and consistent and to make&#xD;
        sure that the developed system adheres to the architecture. &#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Goal-oriented and proactive&lt;/b> &lt;strong>orientation&lt;/strong> &lt;b>with a relentless focus on&#xD;
        results. &lt;/b>This person is the technical driving force behind the project, not a visionary or dreamer. The&#xD;
        career of a successful architect is a long series of sub-optimal decisions made in uncertainty and under pressure.&#xD;
        Only those who can focus on doing what needs to be done will be successful.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    From an expertise standpoint, the Architect also needs to show both design and implementation abilities. However, from&#xD;
    the design perspective, the effective Architect typically exhibits these traits:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Tends to be a generalist, rather than a specialist, who knows many technologies at a high level rather than a few&#xD;
        technologies at the detailed level&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Makes the broader technical decisions, thereby demonstrating broad knowledge and experience, as well as&#xD;
        communication and leadership skills&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></skills>
  <assignmentApproaches>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The person in this role should be engaged in the project from start to finish.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For smaller projects, a single person can act as both Architect and project manager. However, it is better to have&#xD;
    these roles performed by different people to ensure that the pressures of one role does not cause neglect of the other&#xD;
    role. The Architect and Project Manager must work together closely.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For systems of scale, it is a common best practice to have an architecture board that is populated by the architects of&#xD;
    each system, plus one or two chief architects.  In such cases, the members of the architecture board collectively&#xD;
    play the role of the Architect.&#xD;
&lt;/p></assignmentApproaches>
