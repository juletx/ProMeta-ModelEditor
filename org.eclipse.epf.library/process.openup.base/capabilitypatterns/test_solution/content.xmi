    <mainDescription>&lt;p>
    This activity is repeated throughout the project lifecycle. The main goal of this activity is to validate that the
    current build of the system satisfies the requirements allocated to it.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Throughout the iterations, your intent is to validate that the implemented requirements reflect a robust architecture,
    and that the remaining requirements are consistently implemented on top of that architecture. As developers implement
    the solution for the requirements in a given iteration, unit test the integrated source code. Then, a
    tester&amp;nbsp;conducts system-level testing in parallel with development to make sure that the solution, which is
    continuously being integrated, satisfies the intent specified in the test cases. The tester defines what techniques to
    use, what the data input is, and what test suites to create. As tests run, defects are identified and added to the work
    items list, so that they can be prioritized as part of the work that you will do during iterations.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    stakeholders and end-users also may also be involved in performing tests to accept the release.

    <usageNotes>&lt;p>
    Testing must occur throughout the process and throughout each iteration. Testing is not a final inspection to be
    performed at the end of the project. As requirements are implemented and integrated into a build, you should test them
    as soon as possible.
&lt;/p></usageNotes>

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A test case specifies the conditions that must be validated to enable an assessment of aspects of the system under&#xD;
    test. A test case is more formal than a test idea; typically, a test case takes the form of a specification. In less&#xD;
    formal environments, you can create test cases by identifying a unique ID, name, associated test data, and expected&#xD;
    results.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Test cases can be derived from many sources, and typically include a subset of the requirements (such as use cases,&#xD;
    performance characteristics, and reliability concerns) and other types of quality attributes. For more information on&#xD;
    types of tests and their relationships to quality test attributes, see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Run all tests as frequently as possible. Ideally, run all test scripts against each build deployed to the test&#xD;
        environment. If this is impractical, run regression tests for existing functionality, and&amp;nbsp;focus the test cycle&#xD;
        on work items completed in the new build.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Even test scripts that are expected to fail provide valuable feedback. However, once a test script is passing, it&#xD;
        should not fail&amp;nbsp;against subsequent builds of the solution.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>This artifact provides a detailed, typically time-based record that both verifies that a set of tests were run, and&#xD;
provides information that relates to the success of those tests. The focus is typically on providing an accurate audit&#xD;
trail, which enables you to undertake a post-run diagnosis of failures. This raw data is subsequently analyzed to determine&#xD;
the results of an aspect of the test effort.</refinedDescription>
