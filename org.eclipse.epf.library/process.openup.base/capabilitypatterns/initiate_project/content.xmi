    <mainDescription>&lt;p>
    This activity takes place at the beginning of the first iteration, when the project starts. The goal of this activity
    is to establish the vision for both the project and the project plan at a high level of granularity.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    The people in the roles involved at this time collaborate to perform this activity:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        The &lt;a class=&quot;elementlinkwithusertext&quot; href=&quot;./../../core.default.role_def.base/roles/analyst_39D7C49B.html&quot; guid=&quot;_0VxJsMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw&quot;>Analyst&lt;/a> and &lt;a class=&quot;elementlinkwithusertext&quot; href=&quot;./../../core.default.role_def.base/roles/stakeholder_9FFD4106.html&quot; guid=&quot;_dTa6gMAYEdqX-s4mWhkyqQ&quot;>Stakeholder&lt;/a> roles work together to define the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot; href=&quot;./../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/workproducts/vision_2E71B03C.html&quot; guid=&quot;_0WVxcMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw&quot;>vision&lt;/a>
        for the project, capturing the customer needs and features for the system under development. Needs and features are
        captured to the extent required to reach agreement about the scope of the project.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        The project manager (collaborating and reaching agreement with the development team and stakeholders) proposes a
        high-level &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot; href=&quot;./../../practice.mgmt.two_level_project_planning.base/workproducts/project_plan_1CDBB7E4.html&quot; guid=&quot;_0a6vcMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw&quot;>project plan&lt;/a> that includes the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot; href=&quot;./../../practice.mgmt.risk_value_lifecycle.base/guidances/concepts/phase_milestones_5678231E.html&quot; guid=&quot;_HNxbwMBJEdqSgKaj2SZBmg&quot;>milestones&lt;/a> for the four phases, and time-boxed iterations for each phase. This
        plan, along with the allocation of staff to the project, evolves throughout the phases and defines the pace of the
        project.
    &lt;/li>

    <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is good practice to keep this artifact brief, so you can release it to stakeholders as soon as possible, and to make&#xD;
    the artifact easy for stakeholders to read and understand. You can accomplish this by including only the most important&#xD;
    features and avoiding details of requirements.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Projects that focus on product development might extend the marketing section and include a more detailed product&#xD;
    position statement that is based on their needs and research.&#xD;

&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>Developing the project plan provides an opportunity for the team to agree on project scope, objectives, initial timeframe,&#xD;
and deliverables. It allows the team to begin demonstrating self-organization by defining success criteria and work&#xD;
practices to be used. Collaboration and consensus by all key project participants is the goal, but the role responsible for&#xD;
this task must ensure that everybody is committed to the plan.</refinedDescription>

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact describes how the project is organized, and identifies what practices will be followed. Additionally, it&#xD;
    defines the parameters for tracking project progress, and specifies the high-level objectives of the iterations and&#xD;
    their milestones.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The project plan allows stakeholders and other team members to understand the big picture and, roughly, when to expect&#xD;
    a certain level of functionality be available.&amp;nbsp;Update the plan&amp;nbsp;as often as necessary, usually at the end of&#xD;
    each iteration, in order to reflect changing priorities and needs, as well as record the lessons learned from the&#xD;
    project.&#xD;

    Although listed as an &lt;i>output from&lt;/i> and an &lt;i>input to&lt;/i> tasks associated with the requirements discipline, this&#xD;
    artifact can be updated at any time and by any role as new terms are identified. The terms defined should be used&#xD;
    according to the recorded definitions in all project documentation so that all stakeholders can clearly see that terms&#xD;
    are being used consistently.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    One of the primary decisions when developing&amp;nbsp;this artifact&amp;nbsp;is whether to have all terms in a single glossary&#xD;
    or to maintain terms in several glossaries, business terms artifacts, or models.&amp;nbsp;If terms are defined in multiple&#xD;
    places, you need to communicate all of those sources to the team and decide which take precedence.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It may be important, even in small projects, to reference and use existing broader glossaries, business terms&#xD;
    artifacts, or data models, where they exist.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Industry- and organization-wide glossaries may be referenced, and compliance with such specific chosen standards may be&#xD;
    required.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact&amp;nbsp;helps you avoid miscommunication by providing two essential resources:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A central location to look for terms and abbreviations that are new to development team members&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Definitions of terms that are used in specific ways within the domain&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Definitions for the glossary terms come from several sources, such as requirements documents, specifications, and&#xD;
    discussions with stakeholders and domain experts.&#xD;
&lt;/p></refinedDescription>
