    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Development team members sometimes take documentation for granted, or do not give it enough consideration. However,&#xD;
    after a product is delivered, Customers who pay for the system and for support often do not have enough information to&#xD;
    effectively manage the product.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If a Technical Writer is made available to a development team, that role often takes the burden off the team for&#xD;
    developing the formal product documentation and for ensuring that it is in the correct format and business language. If&#xD;
    a Technical Writer is not available, the development team and Product Owner must make every effort to create enough&#xD;
    documentation to ensure that the features that have been developed for each Release are understood and can be&#xD;
    communicated effectively by the paying Customer to their stakeholders.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Delivering a professionally developed product requires that a development team provide the Customer with accurate,&#xD;
    detailed, and comprehensive product documentation.&#xD;

    User documentation might include all or parts of user manuals (electronic or paper-based), tutorials, frequently asked&#xD;
    questions (FAQs), on-line Help Files, installation instructions, operational procedures, etc. User documentation often&#xD;
    is used as the basis for training materials - if the documentation is of poor quality, the training materials might not&#xD;
    be any better.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Without good user documentation, a system might be well developed by a development team but might not meet the End User's&#xD;
    expectations because they will not be able operate the application effectively.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Support documentation often is the most overlooked aspect of a documentation effort. Anyone who has had the opportunity&#xD;
    to provide End User support for a particular application can appreciate how important effective, well-written support&#xD;
    documentation can be. This documentation very often is technical in nature and differs significantly from user or&#xD;
    product documentation, which normally is written for the lay person.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The development team should do its best to make sure that personnel who perform an IT support role have the right amount and&#xD;
    the relevant type of information necessary to support the application, whether they provide Tier 1, Tier 2, or Tier 3&#xD;
    support. Support documentation often is developed based on these three different support categories. How&#xD;
    effectively the code base is commented and the ease with which those comments are found and understood contributes to&#xD;
    the quality and quantity of support documentation.&#xD;

    Some organizations might engage a Technical Writer to help a development team review and refine the documentation that&#xD;
    is produced by the team during a Sprint/Iteration in support of delivered features.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    Because they often are skilled at creating and maintaining technical documentation, Technical Writers help to ensure&#xD;

    <keyConsiderations>The Product Owner's commitment is essential to ensure the project success. By defining the product vision, they provide&#xD;
direction to the team. By externally promoting each Sprint/Iteration result, the Product Owner brings recognition and motivation&#xD;
to the team.</keyConsiderations>
    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This role is the one and only person responsible for managing the Product Backlog and ensuring the value of the work&#xD;
    the development team performs. The Product Owner has the responsibility of defining what is the right product to build,&#xD;
    determining the order in which features will be built, and making sure that the product actually works. The Product&#xD;
    Owner is responsible for defining the features of the product to be developed by the team in terms of:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Functionality:&lt;/strong> Identifies each product requirement as a Product Backlog Item and supplies&#xD;
        details for those requirements when they are needed by the team, including specifying the acceptance tests for&#xD;
        each requirement&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Priority:&lt;/strong> Defines the order in which those backlog items will be developed, according to the value&#xD;
        that they bring to Customers and users, which provides the team with a Product Backlog ready for Sprint/Iteration&#xD;
        planning&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Goal:&lt;/strong> Defines the release goals and makes decisions concerning release planning&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Product Owner has the following responsibilities:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul class=&quot;noindent&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Define the features of the product&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Decide on release date and content&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Responsible for the profitability of the product (ROI)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Prioritize features according to market value&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Adjust features and priorities as needed&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Accept or reject work results&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This person maintains the Product Backlog and ensures that it is visible to everyone. Everyone understands what items&#xD;
    have the highest priority, so everyone on the development team knows what will be worked on.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Product Owner is one person, not a committee. Committees may exist that advise or influence this person but team&#xD;
    members who want to change an item's priority must first convince the Product Owner. In this way, organizational&#xD;
    methods for setting priorities and requirements are influenced over time by this role.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For the Product Owner to succeed, everyone in the organization must respect their decisions. No one is allowed to&#xD;
    direct the development team to work from a different set of priorities. Team members are not allowed to follow the direction&#xD;
    of anyone whose direction does not coincide with the direction provided by the Product Owner. The Product Ownerâ€™s&#xD;
    decisions are visible in the content and prioritization of the Product Backlog. This visibility requires that the&#xD;
    Product Owner do their best. Visibility makes the role of Product Owner both a demanding and a rewarding experience.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Product Owner is responsible for the first of the three Scrum ceremonies, Sprint/Iteration Planning. The development team evaluates&#xD;
    the prioritized Product Backlog, identifies the top priority items, and commits to completing the selected items during&#xD;
    a Sprint/Iteration. These items become the basis for the Sprint/Iteration Backlog.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In return for the development team's commitment to completing the selected tasks, the Product Owner commits that they will&#xD;
    not introduce new requirements to the team during the Sprint/Iteration. Requirements are allowed to change but only outside the&#xD;
    Sprint/Iteration. After the team begins a Sprint/Iteration, it remains focused on the goals of that Sprint/Iteration. The only exception to this&#xD;
    rule is that a similar amount of work can be removed from a Sprint/Iteration to accommodate a new requirement.&#xD;
&lt;/p></refinedDescription>

    Product documentation is created for the benefit of the marketing arm of an organization, the Program Manager, and&#xD;
    those people who must assess the business value of a particular system.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This is an often overlooked aspect of development team implementation. The team should consider that the customers of a&#xD;
    particular Release usually are not technical themselves, but do require a detailed enough understanding of how their&#xD;
    product operates and how it meets stated business goals and needs.&#xD;

    <refinedDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Support documentation usually is developed for the three common tiers of a support organization. Tier 1 typically is&#xD;
    the Help Desk where users call when they have a problem with a particular system. Tier 1 support personnel&#xD;
    normally answer basic questions and, if necessary, log a ticket and escalate it to the appropriate Level 2 support&#xD;
    desk.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Tier 2 support personnel may deal with more complex questions or issues regarding an application and might need to&#xD;
    do some research on the characteristics of the system to provide an answer. If that person cannot resolve the&#xD;
    issue, the ticket is escalated to Tier 3 support personnel who have a deeper understanding of the application's&#xD;
    code and the technology support the system's architecture.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    To properly convey the necessary information to each support tier, the application's code base should be well commented&#xD;
    and logically organized. This approach will facilitate the development of the support documentation.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Support documentation typically includes:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        User manuals with work instructions, process descriptions, and procedures&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

    Having the correct amount and type of materials available to adequately train End Users and supporters of an&#xD;
    application is necessary to promote usability and to achieve the desired business value. If a Course Developer is&#xD;
    available, they can assume most of the burden of creating the training materials, lab exercises, and workshops&amp;nbsp;for&#xD;
    delivery of&amp;nbsp;those courses to either End Users or support personnel. If a Course Developer is not&#xD;
    available,&amp;nbsp;Development team members should take the time to properly develop a suite of training materials for the&#xD;
    feature set developed during a Release.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Although different parts of training materials should be created during Feature Development Sprint/Iterations, the bulk of the&#xD;
    work (and the integration of the materials) usually is reserved for the Release Sprint/Iteration that occurs immediately before a&#xD;
