  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Method Composer is generic term that is used to apply to EPF Composer and its extensions, such as Rational (R) Method&#xD;
    Composer.&amp;nbsp; Method Composer has two purposes:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    1. To provide a knowledge base of intellectual capital.&amp;nbsp; This knowledge base can be used for reference and&#xD;
    education.&amp;nbsp; It can be used to communicate best practices across an organization in a consistent form.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    2. To provide process engineering capabilities by supporting process engineers and project managers in selecting,&#xD;
    tailoring, and rapidly assembling processes for different kinds of development projects. Method Composer provides&#xD;
    catalogs of pre-defined processes for typical project situations that can be adapted to individual needs. It also&#xD;
    provides process building blocks that represent best development practices for specific disciplines, technologies, or&#xD;
    development styles. These building blocks form a toolkit for quickly assembling processes based on project specific&#xD;
    needs. The resulting processes created with Method Composer can be published and deployed as Web sites.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
