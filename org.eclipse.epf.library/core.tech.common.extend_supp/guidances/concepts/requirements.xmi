  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Requirements are the project team's to-do list.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Requirements define what is needed and focus the project team. They are the primary method used to communicate the&#xD;
    goals of the project to everyone on the team.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Requirements define:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What the stakeholders need; and&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What the system must include to satisfy the stakeholders' needs.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Requirements are the basis for capturing and communicating needs, managing expectations, prioritizing and assigning&#xD;
    work, verifying and validating the system (acceptance), and managing the scope of the project.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Requirements may take different forms, including scenarios, unstructured text, structured text, or a combination, and&#xD;
    they may be stated at different levels of granularity. At the highest level of granularity, features&amp;nbsp;define the&#xD;
    services that the system must provide to solve the customer's problem. These are captured as structured or unstructured&#xD;
    text in the project vision. At the next level of granularity, use cases can be used to define the functionality that&#xD;
    the system must provide to deliver the required features.&amp;nbsp;Use cases&amp;nbsp;describe the sequence of actions&#xD;
    performed by the system to yield an observable result of value.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As mentioned, a&amp;nbsp;system must perform according to the behavior that can be specified as use cases. However, there&#xD;
    are system requirements that do not represent a specific behavior, also&amp;nbsp;known as system-wide requirements,&#xD;
    including:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Legal and regulatory requirements, as well as application standards&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Quality attributes of the system to be built, including usability, reliability, performance, and supportability&#xD;
        requirements&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Interface requirements to be able to communicate with external systems&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Design constraints, such as those for operating systems and environments and for compatibility with other software&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></mainDescription>
