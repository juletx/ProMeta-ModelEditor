    Make sure that you have found the root cause of the stakeholder's problem or need. Often, stakeholders define solutions&#xD;
    rather than stating the problem that they are experiencing or the pain they are experiencing. Subsequently, they may&#xD;
    not have identified the problem correctly or the correct solution for it.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For example, &quot;We can't support customers who want to buy online&quot; is better than &quot;We need an on-line purchasing system&quot;.&#xD;
