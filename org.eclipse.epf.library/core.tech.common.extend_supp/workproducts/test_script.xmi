  <purpose>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Test scripts implement a subset of required tests in an efficient and effective manner.&#xD;
&lt;/p></purpose>
  <impactOfNotHaving>Without this artifact, it is difficult to ensure that tests are run consistently so that results are repeatable and errors&#xD;
can be recreated. If you do not use a test script, it is more difficult to verify that errors were not caused because of&#xD;
the way tests were run.</impactOfNotHaving>
  <reasonsForNotNeeding>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact might not be required if the tests are simple or if testing is done on an informal basis. However, for&#xD;
    this approach to be successful, testers must track their processes, as they might need to recreate a problem scenario.&#xD;
    Alternatively, you can use automatic capture and playback tools to provide a record of testing.&#xD;
