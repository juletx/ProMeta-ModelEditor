  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This working version of the system or part of the system&amp;nbsp;is the result of putting the implementation through a&#xD;
    build process (typically an automated build script) that creates an executable version, or one that runs. This&#xD;
    executable version will typically have a number of supporting files that are also considered part of this artifact.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>
  <purpose>Deliver incremental value to the user and customer, and provide a testable artifact for verification.</purpose>
  <impactOfNotHaving>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Without this artifact, there is no operational version of the system.&#xD;
&lt;/p></impactOfNotHaving>
  <reasonsForNotNeeding>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact is not needed if the development of an application is not within the scope of the solution.&#xD;
&lt;/p></reasonsForNotNeeding>
  <representationOptions>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This work product is almost always a product made up of numerous parts required to make the executable system.&#xD;
    Therefore, a build is more than just executable files; it also includes such things as configuration files, help files,&#xD;
    and data repositories that will be put together, resulting in the product that the users will run. The specifics of&#xD;
    those parts will vary by technology in use.&#xD;
