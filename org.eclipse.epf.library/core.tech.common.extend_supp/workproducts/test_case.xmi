  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A test case specifies the conditions that must be validated to enable an assessment of aspects of the system under&#xD;
    test. A test case is more formal than a test idea; typically, a test case takes the form of a specification. In less&#xD;
    formal environments, you can create test cases by identifying a unique ID, name, associated test data, and expected&#xD;
    results.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Test cases can be derived from many sources, and typically include a subset of the requirements (such as use cases,&#xD;
    performance characteristics, and reliability concerns) and other types of quality attributes. For more information on&#xD;
    types of tests and their relationships to quality test attributes, see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

  <purpose>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Use this artifact for the following purposes:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        To provide a way to capture test inputs, conditions, and expected results for a system&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        To systematically identify aspects of the software to test&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        To specify whether an expected result has been reached, based on the verification of a system requirement, set of&#xD;
        requirements, or scenario&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></purpose>
  <impactOfNotHaving>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Without this artifact, it is difficult to validate system functionality. Because this artifact specifies the conditions&#xD;
    of acceptance between the stakeholders and the developers, without the artifact, it is difficult to establish exit&#xD;
    criteria and to demonstrate that the exit criteria have been met. If the original test cases have not been documented,&#xD;
    it is impossible to do regression testing.&#xD;
&lt;/p></impactOfNotHaving>
  <reasonsForNotNeeding>&lt;p>&#xD;
    It might not be necessary to create this artifact to maintain or make small enhancements to existing systems, which&#xD;
    likely have existing test assets that you can use. You also might not need this artifact if you use a package&#xD;
    application that has its own set of test cases.&#xD;
&lt;/p></reasonsForNotNeeding>
