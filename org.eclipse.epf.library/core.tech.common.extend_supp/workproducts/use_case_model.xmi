  <purpose>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact presents an overview of the intended behavior of the system. It is the basis for agreement between&#xD;
    stakeholders and the project team in regards to the intended functionality of the system. It also guides various tasks&#xD;
    in the software development lifecycle.&#xD;
&lt;/p></purpose>
  <impactOfNotHaving>Without this artifact, it is difficult to determine all of the relationships between actors and use cases. It is also&#xD;
difficult to gain an understanding of how different use cases relate.</impactOfNotHaving>
  <reasonsForNotNeeding>&lt;p>&#xD;
    You might not need this requirement if the overall set of use cases is small and has no complex relationships.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    You also might not need a use-case model if you use an alternative approach to document functional requirements.&#xD;
&lt;/p></reasonsForNotNeeding>
  <representationOptions>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Representation options include reports and diagrams from UML modeling tools, graphical representations created by using&#xD;
    drawing tools, and drawings on whiteboards. Most of the information in the use-case model is captured in the use-case&#xD;
    specifications.&#xD;
&lt;/p></representationOptions>
