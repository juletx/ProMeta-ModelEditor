  <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is good practice to keep this artifact brief, so you can release it to stakeholders as soon as possible, and to make&#xD;
    the artifact easy for stakeholders to read and understand. You can accomplish this by including only the most important&#xD;
    features and avoiding details of requirements.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Projects that focus on product development might extend the marketing section and include a more detailed product&#xD;
    position statement that is based on their needs and research.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
  <purpose>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact provides a high-level basis for more detailed technical requirements. It captures the technical solution&#xD;
    by describing the high-level stakeholder requests and constraints that give an overview of the reasoning, background,&#xD;
    and context for detailed requirements. The vision serves as input for communicating the fundamental &quot;what and why&quot; for&#xD;
    the project and provides a strategy against which all future decisions can be validated.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The vision should rally team members behind an idea and give them the context for decision-making in the requirements&#xD;
    area. The vision must be visible to everyone on the team.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p></purpose>
  <impactOfNotHaving>If you do not state a vision, stakeholders and the development team might have different expectations of the project. This&#xD;
can lead to cancellation of the project. Misunderstandings and miscommunication about the strategy can cause the project to&#xD;
move from the original vision and create discrepancies in stakeholder expectations.</impactOfNotHaving>
  <reasonsForNotNeeding>Use this artifact for all but trivial projects.</reasonsForNotNeeding>
  <representationOptions>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Typically, the vision is represented in a document. If key stakeholder needs are captured in a requirements management&#xD;
    tool, this part of the document can be generated by using reporting capabilities.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If the vision serves a set of projects or an entire program, the overall vision might be divided into several vision&#xD;
    work products. In this case, the vision of the program brings the visions together by providing program-specific&#xD;
    content and referencing the subordinate visions.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p></representationOptions>
