    Data management need to be considered from the methodology point of view, such as data origination, data management,&#xD;
    and data consumption. The architect needs to understand how the master data are coming from and how they are updated.&#xD;
    The life cycle of such data can lead to version and management control, that may add complexity on top of the services&#xD;
    versioning. The data consumption has to be addressed for the execution environment and also in the case of BRMS&#xD;
    deployment for the rule authoring environment.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The following diagram highlights a high level architecture&amp;nbsp;architect can leverage to design&amp;nbsp;his own solution.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;./resources/mdm.jpg&quot; width=&quot;557&quot; height=&quot;499&quot; />&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The master data are centralized in a repository, and technology as Master Data Management product can be&amp;nbsp;used for&#xD;
    that. The different sources of data are synchronized with this repository on a regular basis, using different&#xD;
    implementation mechanism based on ETL, ESB, web services or custom layer. A mapping mechanism&amp;nbsp;as to be applied to&#xD;
    persist the data in the repository. The Execution environment can fetch the last version or a given version of the data&#xD;
    from this repository and cache it.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The same applies for the rule authoring environment: The&amp;nbsp;BRMS server can load the data and cache it in the web&#xD;
    server. With such simple architecture the rule writer can have access to a unique definition of the enumerated domains&#xD;
    or other business objects, like a Product definition.&#xD;
