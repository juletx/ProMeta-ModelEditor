    &lt;em>Getting Started&lt;/em>
&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>
    Understand&amp;nbsp;the basic building blocks of methods and how to define and customize them.&amp;nbsp; Implement your method
    assets and publish a method configuration that can be reviewed by your stakeholders.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    As you apply the recommendations described in the practice, capture what you have learned, what worked for your team
    and what didn't so that you can continually fine-tune how your team applies the practice.
&lt;/p>
&lt;h3>
    &lt;em>Common Pitfalls&lt;/em>
&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>
    Following are some common pitfalls when adopting this practice:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        Spending too much time developing method assets to get them &quot;perfect&quot; before trying them out with real project
        work. Define just enough to get started and then gather feedback for improvement from teams as they use the assets.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Creating too many method assets at too fine-grained a level can overwhelm and confuse teams. Confirm that you
        understand the requirements for each asset and how it will help project teams before investing a lot of time in
        development.&lt;br />
        &lt;br />
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></mainDescription>
