  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact describes how the project is organized, and identifies what practices will be followed. Additionally, it&#xD;
    defines the parameters for tracking project progress, and specifies the high-level objectives of the iterations and&#xD;
    their milestones.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The project plan allows stakeholders and other team members to understand the big picture and, roughly, when to expect&#xD;
    a certain level of functionality be available.&amp;nbsp;Update the plan&amp;nbsp;as often as necessary, usually at the end of&#xD;
    each iteration, in order to reflect changing priorities and needs, as well as record the lessons learned from the&#xD;
    project.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>
  <keyConsiderations>Create and update the project plan in planning sessions that involve the whole team and appropriate project stakeholders in&#xD;
order to make sure that everybody agrees with it.</keyConsiderations>
  <purpose>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The purpose of this artifact is&amp;nbsp;to provide a central document where any project team member can find the&#xD;
    information on how the project will be conducted.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p></purpose>
  <impactOfNotHaving>Without this artifact, there can be a lack of clear boundaries of the project scope that can lead to: &#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Risks of gaps or overlap between the roles acting on the project&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Poorly defined or inadequate plan for the project&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Subsequent difficulties in controlling the project&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></impactOfNotHaving>
  <reasonsForNotNeeding>This artifact is typically required in some form on all but the smallest projects.&amp;nbsp; However, projects taking a purely&#xD;
evolutionary or maintenance approach to development may choose to omit this artifact.</reasonsForNotNeeding>
