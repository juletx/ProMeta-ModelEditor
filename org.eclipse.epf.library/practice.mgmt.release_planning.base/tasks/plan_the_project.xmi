  <mainDescription>Developing the project plan provides an opportunity for the team to agree on project scope, objectives, initial timeframe,&#xD;
and deliverables. It allows the team to begin demonstrating self-organization by defining success criteria and work&#xD;
practices to be used. Collaboration and consensus by all key project participants is the goal, but the role responsible for&#xD;
this task must ensure that everybody is committed to the plan.</mainDescription>
  <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Gain agreement with stakeholders and the rest of the project team regarding the order of objectives and the duration of&#xD;
    the project. Make adjustments as&amp;nbsp;necessary.&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The&amp;nbsp;team produces rough size estimates for each work item&amp;nbsp;found in the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../core.mgmt.slot.base/workproducts/project_work_slot_F12BAC46.html&quot; guid=&quot;_1QZI8EfUEdyiPI8btkmvmw&quot;>[Project&#xD;
    Work]&lt;/a>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Discuss with stakeholders to&amp;nbsp;determine what is realistic to develop within the constraints of the&#xD;
    project.&amp;nbsp;Use stakeholder priorities and estimates from the team to guide these discussions.&#xD;
&lt;/p></sectionDescription>

  <sections xmi:id="_4Xg3QOFpEdyhmsbt0Xyl8A" name="Forecast project velocity and duration" guid="_4Xg3QOFpEdyhmsbt0Xyl8A">
    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Define the iteration length and use it to assess target velocity. The number of items to be delivered in each iteration&#xD;
    will be set by the velocity of the team and the estimates for each item.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If the project is feature-driven, the team uses the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../core.mgmt.slot.base/workproducts/project_work_slot_F12BAC46.html&quot; guid=&quot;_1QZI8EfUEdyiPI8btkmvmw&quot;>[Project&#xD;
    Work]&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;and target velocity to forecast the number of iterations required to complete the project. If the&#xD;
    project instead is date-driven, the team assesses (using the known velocity of the&amp;nbsp;team) roughly how much work can&#xD;
    be done in the given time-frame. Out-of-scope work can be considered&amp;nbsp;for future releases.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The team should not spend too much time&amp;nbsp;doing this planning. The project plan should document only&amp;nbsp;a brief&#xD;
    summary of&amp;nbsp;project milestones&amp;nbsp;and between one and three objectives for each iteration. Do not commit&#xD;
    individual work items to the plan, because this will force too much re-planning. The goal is just to create a&#xD;
    high-level plan outlining how&amp;nbsp;the team&amp;nbsp;can build the resulting application in the given set of iterations.&#xD;
    Extra levels of detail will be achieved in other planning sessions throughout the project (for example, when planning&#xD;
    iterations). You may need to revisit&amp;nbsp;this plan&amp;nbsp;later to adapt it based on what you will&#xD;
    learn&amp;nbsp;by&amp;nbsp;running&amp;nbsp;the iterations.&#xD;

    The team identifies project risks, performs a qualitative risk analysis to assess their order of magnitude, and updates&#xD;

    they should respond to, and which risks they should watch for.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Responses may include avoiding or mitigating risks, exploring opportunities, or increasing the probability and positive&#xD;
    impacts of the risk. Depending on the case, work items may have to be added or removed from the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;

    Work]&lt;/a> to make sure that responses will be prioritized and handled by the team along with other project work.&#xD;
    Because it is not feasible to plan responses for all identified risks, the team&amp;nbsp;may decide to accept some of them.&#xD;
    Keep the risks to watch in the risks list, and communicate them to stakeholders.&amp;nbsp;Determine actions only if they&#xD;
    occur.&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Develop a rough order of magnitude estimate for the costs of resources needed to complete project work items.&amp;nbsp;A&#xD;
    simplified project costing model&amp;nbsp;can be&amp;nbsp;applied by&amp;nbsp;multiplying the approximate cost per person for the&#xD;
    entire team by the length of an iteration to derive ongoing financial impact (that is, cost per iteration). This first&#xD;
    round of planning should keep things very rough and flexible. The goal is just to articulate value against the budget&#xD;
    constraints of the project, and to help stakeholders decide whether it is worth moving forward with the project or not.&#xD;
    If necessary, propose options to decrease costs, such as removing low-value and high-cost work items from the scope .&#xD;

    that the project fits into the overall corporate deployment system.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Whenever possible, the team should consider deploying small releases (release cycles of three to four months at most).&#xD;
    Releasing software into production frequently is a good way to&amp;nbsp;get early feedback from the users, in order&#xD;
    to&amp;nbsp;enhance the overall product quality.&#xD;
