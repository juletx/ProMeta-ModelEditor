    Use-case modeling&amp;nbsp;is one technique that can prove useful in defining the system boundaries and system behavior.&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Avoid rushing into defining the solution. First, gain agreement on the definition of the problem by asking the&#xD;
    stakeholders what they see as the problem. Then search for root causes, or the &quot;problem behind the problem&quot;.&#xD;
    Use&amp;nbsp;appropriate requirements gathering techniques. Formulate the problem statement. The purpose of this is to help&#xD;
    you distinguish solutions and answers from problems and questions.&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Use the most appropriate technique to help you on requirements gathering.&amp;nbsp;Each technique is applicable in a&#xD;
    particular situation or to a certain type of stakeholder.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If you can meet stakeholders in person, then you can conduct an interview or a brainstorming session. This face-to-face&#xD;
    collaboration is extremely valuable and reduces the chances of the project team misunderstanding the needs of the&#xD;
    stakeholders.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Some requirements&amp;nbsp;might already be documented in other work products (such as in change requests or work&#xD;
    items).&amp;nbsp; This can often be used as a solid starting position from which a full set of requirements can be created.&#xD;
