    Getting started&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Creating a shared vision involves understanding and agreeing on the fundamental &quot;what&quot; and &quot;why&quot; of the product under&#xD;
    development. This ensures that stakeholders and the development team have a common understanding of the problem to be&#xD;
    solved, and understand the stakeholders' needs.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Begin by reviewing the reference material associated with this practice to better understand the intent of the&#xD;
    practice. Review the template for the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/workproducts/vision_2E71B03C.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_0WVxcMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw&quot;>Vision&lt;/a> to understand the information that it captures. Tailor the template for the&#xD;
    specific needs of the project. Review the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../practice.tech.shared_vision.base/tasks/develop_technical_vision_9D36CF2F.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_0fOAoMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw&quot;>Develop Technical Vision&lt;/a> task to understand what needs to be performed to capture&#xD;
    and communicate the vision. Review the guidelines on requirements gathering techniques and requirements reviews&#xD;
    associated with the Develop Technical Vision task, and select the appropriate technique(s) for the project. Educate the&#xD;
    development team and relevant stakeholders on the purpose of this practice, and get buy-in on the techniques that will&#xD;
    be used to establish and maintain a shared vision.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This practice is related to many other useful practices. For example:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Requirements practices: the vision is one of the outcomes of stakeholder requests elicitation. It is also the&#xD;
        primary input for developing more fine-grained technical requirements. stakeholders and the development team use&#xD;
        the vision to provide the context and high-level objectives for the detailed technical requirements.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Architecture practices: the vision outlines the high-level objectives and constraints for the system that inform&#xD;
        architectural design decisions.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Project management practices: the vision defines the scope and constraints of the project that are the basis for&#xD;
        work prioritization and initial estimates of effort. The value delivered by the team at each milestone must align&#xD;
        with stakeholders' expectations, expressed by the project vision.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Common pitfalls&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;b>Rushing into a solution before the problem is understood.&lt;/b> The result is typically a system that fails to solve&#xD;
    stakeholder problems and satisfy stakeholder needs. Avoid design while capturing the vision. Focus on the &quot;what&quot; and&#xD;
    &quot;why&quot; of the product, rather than detailing the solution. Detailed technical requirements will be developed later, in&#xD;
    conjunction with architectural design and trade-off analysis.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;b>Failure to gain agreement on the problem to be solved.&lt;/b> Make sure that you have identified all stakeholders,&#xD;
    captured their needs and wishes, and obtained agreement on the problem to be solved and associated constraints. Missing&#xD;
    a critical stakeholder can result in significant re-work later.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;b>Failure to manage scope.&lt;/b> Rome was not built in a day (or in a single project). Make sure that you capture&#xD;
    stakeholder needs and features, and prioritize them to deliver as much value as early as possible. If the estimated&#xD;
    effort is too great to commit to for a single external release, divide and conquer. The product vision may span more&#xD;
    than one release of the product, providing a roadmap for future work, as well as work planned for the current project.&#xD;
