    The key activities normally used to package a release:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Assemble the components and integrate them through a normal (i.e., continuous integration) or release build script&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Install the release package in one or more test environments and verify its integrity&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Tag the elements of the release package in the code base to create a baseline&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Package appropriate documentation to accompany the release: &#xD;
        &lt;ul>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Deployment plan&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Build plan, procedures, and scripts&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Backout plan&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Relevant licensing information&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Relevant infrastructure information&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Release communiques&#xD;

  <sections xmi:id="_IAEdheB-EeC1y_NExchKwQ" name="Assemble components" guid="_IAEdheB-EeC1y_NExchKwQ">
    <sectionDescription>Question all the developers on the development team to determine which components are ready for packaging. Only package&#xD;
those components that were completed and accepted during the previous feature development sprint/iterations. Components&#xD;
that were not finished or not accepted should not be bundled, unless the customer has granted an exception or they are&#xD;
infrastructure-related components.</sectionDescription>

    <sectionDescription>After the components have been packaged and built, that executable should be installed and run in a test environment that&#xD;
mimics the production environment. A &quot;staging&quot; environment usually is maintained for this purpose. Testing typically&#xD;
includes a &quot;smoke test&quot; in which key features are exercised to highlight any unplanned behavior.</sectionDescription>

    <sectionDescription>In the team's configuration management (CM) tool, tag all the components that went into the release package so that the&#xD;
