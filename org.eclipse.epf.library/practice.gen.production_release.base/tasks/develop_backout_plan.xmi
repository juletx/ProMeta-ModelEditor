  <mainDescription>A rollback might be needed for a variety of reasons, including corruption of the production code base, inoperable&#xD;
components, an unplanned undesirable effect of the release on other production systems, an unhappy customer, etc.&#xD;
The&amp;nbsp;Development team should provide the production support organization with a specific plan and decision criteria&#xD;
made available to them to avoid or minimize service interruptions.</mainDescription>

    <sectionDescription>Determine whether the development team has a backout plan already written for a previous release. If so, part of that plan&#xD;
might be reusable. If this release is the development team's first, another development team with a similar feature set&#xD;
might have a plan that can be used as a starting point.</sectionDescription>

    <sectionDescription>If a backout plan does exist that can be used as a baseline, review that plan and update, add, or delete information as&#xD;
necessary. When the plan is completed, it should reflect entirely the contents of the upcoming deployment only, not a&#xD;
release in the past or one in the future. In other words, the backout plan should be specific only to this release.</sectionDescription>

  <purpose>The purpose of this task is to develop the criteria, procedures, and responsibilities associated with rolling back a&#xD;
specific release into the production environment to prevent or minimize interruptions to other products or services.</purpose>
