  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A release package cannot be deployed to production if the environmental infrastructure within which the release will be&#xD;
    run is not sufficiently built or tested. Whether the release is deployed as a &quot;push&quot; (where the application is deployed&#xD;
    from a central point and proactively delivered to target locations) or a &quot;pull&quot; (where the application is made&#xD;
    available at central point and pulled by a user at a time of their choosing), the infrastructure needed to support the&#xD;
    application must be considered and implemented.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Some key aspects of installing and/or validating the desired infrastructure:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Identify the requirements and components of the environment configuration&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Determine the lead times required to establish the infrastructure environments&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Procure and install the infrastructure components that are not yet available&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Test the newly installed infrastructure components&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Test the integration of newly installed components with the rest of the environmental configuration&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Validate other aspects of the infrastructure including: &#xD;
        &lt;ul>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Security components and their integration&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Database connectivity and security&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                License management, as appropriate&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Configuration management, in terms of configuration items (CIs)&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;/ul>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

  <sections xmi:id="_IAIH4-B-EeC1y_NExchKwQ" name="Identify infrastructure needs" guid="_IAIH4-B-EeC1y_NExchKwQ">
    <sectionDescription>Identify and describe all the components of the infrastructure that are needed to support the upcoming release. These&#xD;
requirements should be based completely on the feature set that is about to be deployed, not on intended future needs.</sectionDescription>
  </sections>
  <sections xmi:id="_IAIu8eB-EeC1y_NExchKwQ" name="Procure components" guid="_IAIu8eB-EeC1y_NExchKwQ">
    <sectionDescription>Determine how long it will reasonably take to procure the needed components and to engage the appropriate division in the&#xD;
organization to place the order. Be sure to work with the procurement agency to track the order and to identify any issues&#xD;
with that order. Ultimately, the development team, not the procurement agency, is responsible for ensuring that the correct&#xD;
infrastructure components are in place.</sectionDescription>

  <sections xmi:id="_IAIH5OB-EeC1y_NExchKwQ" name="Schedule components for installation" guid="_IAIH5OB-EeC1y_NExchKwQ">
    <sectionDescription>After the procured components arrive, schedule to have them installed by the IT operations group(s) that control the&#xD;
production environment. The development team should be developing tests to confirm the correct installation at this time.</sectionDescription>
  </sections>
  <sections xmi:id="_IAIH4uB-EeC1y_NExchKwQ" name="Install and test components" guid="_IAIH4uB-EeC1y_NExchKwQ">
    <sectionDescription>When the components have been installed, be prepared to run the validation tests developed in the previous step. These&#xD;
tests should not only verify the individual components' readiness, but also should validate their integration with each&#xD;
other and with legacy components.</sectionDescription>
  </sections>
  <sections xmi:id="_IAIu8OB-EeC1y_NExchKwQ" name="Validate other component aspects" guid="_IAIu8OB-EeC1y_NExchKwQ">
    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    As the validation testing is underway, the development team also should consider how the newly installed components&#xD;
    impact overall system security, whether or not database connectivity and security have been compromised, and what&#xD;
    impact they have on the configuration management database that contains an inventory of CIs.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Also reconcile any licensing issues for the new components with the division that is responsible for documenting and&#xD;
    tracking enterprise licenses.&#xD;
&lt;/p></sectionDescription>

  <purpose>The purpose of this task is to ensure that all the necessary infrastructure components needed to support a successful&#xD;
release are in place.</purpose>
