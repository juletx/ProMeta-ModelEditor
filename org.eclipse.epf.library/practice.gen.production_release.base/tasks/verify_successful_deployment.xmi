  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Using the success criteria documented either in the deployment plan or in the backout plan, the deployment engineer, in&#xD;
    collaboration with the development team, will determine whether the rollout can be declared a success or not.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If the deployment is successful, the previously prepared release communiques should be delivered. If the deployment is&#xD;
    unsuccessful, then the backout plan should be invoked.&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>In this step, automated smoke tests should be run to determine whether key components were deployed successfully. These&#xD;
tests should be brief but revealing enough to quickly determine the validity of the deployment.</sectionDescription>

    <sectionDescription>If the automated smoke tests are successful, run several complex manual tests to simulate key end user behavior. These&#xD;
tests should be executed by development team members or stakeholders recruited specifically for this purpose.</sectionDescription>

    <sectionDescription>In some situations, problems with the release might be encountered but are not serious enough to reverse the deployment. If&#xD;
the problem(s) associated with the release can be fixed easily, and if they are not detrimental to the production&#xD;
environment, an emergency bug fix (EBF) might be the answer. In that case, the release is not backed out; rather, an EBF is&#xD;
scheduled to be executed as soon as possible.</sectionDescription>

  <purpose>The purpose of this task is to confirm that a release has not caused any unintentional interruptions to service in the&#xD;
production environment.</purpose>
