  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This task is straightforward: follow the procedures in the Deployment Plan for the rollout of a specific product&#xD;
    release. If the deployment plan does not exist or it is poorly constructed, this task might be much more difficult.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The main point here is that to achieve a high probability of success, the development team should have previously&#xD;
    developed a detailed plan that organizes and articulates all the unique instructions for deploying that particular&#xD;
    release. Because an experienced deployment engineer normally executes this task, they might be able to overcome any&#xD;
    missing deployment procedures or content. However, that is not an excuse for a development team to not develop the&#xD;
    plan's contents.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>

installed and that the system is in the correct state. Also ensure that the release window is ready to be achieved.</sectionDescription>

    When the preliminary review has been completed and the release window has started, deploy the release package into&#xD;
    production. Depending on the release script and the size of the package, this installation might take anywhere from a&#xD;
    few minutes to a few hours.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Monitor the release as the release script is run. Be prepared to terminate the script and back out the release if&#xD;
    significant errors are encountered.&#xD;

  <purpose>The purpose of this task is to ensure that the rollout is based on clear, validated, repeatable instructions and to reduce&#xD;
the risk of a deployment issue.</purpose>
