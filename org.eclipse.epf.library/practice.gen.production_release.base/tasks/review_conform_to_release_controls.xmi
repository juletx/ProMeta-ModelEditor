    Release controls describe the minimum number of requirements that a software package must adhere to before being&#xD;
    released into production. This is especially important if a development team is new or emerging, because they might not&#xD;
    be aware of the great responsibilities a deployment manager has. In fact, a deployment manager is responsible to senior&#xD;
    management for ensuring that nothing is placed into production that does not conform to the rigid controls designed to&#xD;
    protect the IT organization's ability to successfully deliver IT services to internal and external customers.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Release controls typically consist of the following:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Release or deployment plan&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Backout plan&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Release component definitions&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Release package integrity verification&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        References to configuration items (CIs)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Customer approval&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Ready for transfer to operations and support staff&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></mainDescription>

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Coordinated releases at the program level are very formal processes. They are formal for a very good reason - namely,&#xD;
    the company's production environment could be corrupted and serious business ramifications could result, including:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Lost revenue&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        customer dissatisfaction&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Fines resulting from legal noncompliance&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Lost employee productivity&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    All development team members that contribute to a release are expected to adhere to all the controls defined at the&#xD;
    program level. Non-compliance could result in multiple impacts:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The entire release being abandoned, which could lead to customer or end user dissatisfaction&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The results of multiple feature development Sprint/Iterations not being included in the release&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Embarrassment on the part of the development team member that did not comply with the controls&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Loss of funding for that development team&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></sectionDescription>
