  <mainDescription>Assuming a backout plan is available for this release, the deployment engineer (or development team) will follow the&#xD;
instructions for reversing the installation of the product into production, if there is a problem. While the plan might&#xD;
have been written with good intentions, sometimes key procedures are missing or have not been thought out. The team backing&#xD;
out the release should be aware that blindly following the backout plan might not be the best approach. It is best to&#xD;
consider the unique circumstances within which the deployment has failed and rely on common sense and experience when&#xD;
executing the backout plan.</mainDescription>

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    In the event that the release to production experiences problems, either during or after deployment, the backout plan&#xD;
    should be invoked. However, the deployment engineer (or development team) must understand where the release went wrong&#xD;
    so that the code can be fixed before the next release attempt. This is a critical step, but it should be done quickly&#xD;
    so that the problematic release can be reversed before significant damage is done to the production environment.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Log the issues as critical defects as soon as possible and assign those defects to the appropriate team members for&#xD;
    resolution.&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>Following the instructions in the backout plan, reverse the deployment. However, be aware that the backout plan&#xD;
instructions are a guide and should not always be taken literally. This interpretation is due to the fact that not every&#xD;
problematic condition can be documented in advance and because each real-world situation might be slightly different.</sectionDescription>

    <sectionDescription>Ensure that all interested parties are aware of the failed release. Because releases often take place at odd hours to&#xD;
minimize end user impact, use beeper-based notifications judiciously. In most cases, an email to key stakeholders (such as&#xD;
the product owner and program manager) might suffice. Following up with a phone call also might be warranted.</sectionDescription>

  <purpose>The purpose of this task is to remove a specific release quickly and seamlessly from the production environment because the&#xD;
release has caused problems or because it has been determined by the stakeholder community as unfit for service.</purpose>
