  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Because a deployment engineer is responsible for accepting the results of one or more development team members and&#xD;
    deploying those integrated releases into the production environment, it is important for all parties to agree on the&#xD;
    details of a particular release. The deployment plan documents, in one place, all the information that will be consumed&#xD;
    by the deployment engineer before and during the deployment to production of a particular release package.&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>Determine whether the development team has a deployment plan already written for a previous release. If so, part of that&#xD;
plan might be reusable. If this is the development team's first release, another development team with a similar feature&#xD;
set might have a plan that can be used as a starting point.</sectionDescription>

    <sectionDescription>If a deployment plan does exist that can be used as a baseline, review that plan and update, add, or delete information as&#xD;
necessary. When the plan is done, it should reflect entirely the contents of the upcoming deployment only, not a release in&#xD;
the past or one in the future. In other words, the deployment plan should be specific only to this release.</sectionDescription>

  <purpose>The purpose of this task is to ensure that the various aspects of deploying a release to production are considered and&#xD;
understood between the development team and the deployment engineer.</purpose>
