  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Sometimes, depending on the product user base, separate communiques might need to be prepared for each stakeholder&#xD;
    group. In that case, this artifact should specify the different groups to which communications are directed, the method&#xD;
    of communication (e.g., email, text or pager message, bulletin, newsletter, phone message, etc.). All communiques&#xD;
    should be prepared in advance so that it is a matter of disseminating information when the release to production has&#xD;
    been determined to be successful.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Also included in this artifact is a listing of the responsible parties who will execute the communications when a&#xD;
    successful release has been declared (normally the Deployment Engineer), as well as the timing and dependencies of the&#xD;
    communiques.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    While there is no prescribed format for the release communications artifact, each communique should indicate the&#xD;
    preferred delivery mechanisms (for example: beeper notification, telephone calls, a posting to an internal release&#xD;
    website, live or pre-recorded presentations by senior management, etc.). This artifact generally answers the following&#xD;
    questions:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Who are the parties (stakeholders) that are interested in knowing that a release to production has taken place?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What specifically (features, functions, components) has been placed into production?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Why is this release valuable to stakeholders and what business purpose does it serve?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Where is the product available (on which platforms, geographical locations, business units, etc.)?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        How can the stakeholders access the system and under what circumstances?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        When was the product released (or when will it be released if the release date is in the future)?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></mainDescription>
  <purpose>The purpose of this work product is to inform all the various stakeholders that a release to production has taken place and&#xD;
the implemented features are now generally available.</purpose>
