  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact captures the key milestones of an iteration, showing start and end dates, intermediate milestones,&#xD;
    synchronization points with other teams, demos, and so on. This artifact is also used to capture issues that need to be&#xD;
    solved during the iteration.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    You should list a few objectives for the iteration, which will help guide you throughout the iteration. Also, assess at&#xD;
    the end if those objectives have been achieved.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The task assignments for an iteration are a subset of all tasks on the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../core.mgmt.common.extend_supp/workproducts/work_items_list_39D03CC8.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_rGNWsCbSEdqh1LYUOGRh2A&quot;>Artifact: Work Items List&lt;/a>. Therefore, the iteration plan ideally references those&#xD;
    work items.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The evaluation criteria and iteration assessment information are captured in this artifact, so that you can communicate&#xD;
    results and actions from assessments.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>
  <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Work items assigned to an iteration do not necessarily have the same priority. When selecting work items from the Work&#xD;
    Items List, the iteration plan may end up having work items with different priorities (for example, you assign the&#xD;
    remaining high priority work items, plus a few mid-priority ones from the Work Items List). Once work items have been&#xD;
    assigned to the iteration, the team ensures that they can complete all work, regardless of original work item&#xD;
    priorities. Deciding what to develop first on an iteration will vary across projects and iterations.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
  <purpose>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The main objectives of the iteration plan are to provide the team with the following:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        One central place for information regarding iteration objectives&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A detailed plan with task assignments&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Evaluation results&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This artifact also helps the team to monitor the progress of the iteration, and keeps the results of the iteration&#xD;
    assessment that may be useful for improving the next one.&#xD;
&lt;/p></purpose>
  <impactOfNotHaving>Without this artifact, it will be difficult to assess the results of an iteration to determine whether or not the&#xD;
objectives have been met.</impactOfNotHaving>
  <reasonsForNotNeeding>This artifact is not required if no iterations are being performed, or if the scope of the project and each iteration is&#xD;
sufficiently small as to be handled informally amongst the team.</reasonsForNotNeeding>
  <representationOptions>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The level of detail or formality of the plan must be adapted to what you need in order to meet these objectives&#xD;
    successfully. The plan could, for example, be captured on the following places:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A whiteboard listing the objectives, task assignments, and evaluation criteria&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A one-page document listing the objectives and evaluation criteria of the iteration, as well as referencing the&#xD;
        Work Items List for assignments for that iteration&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A more complex document, supported by a Gantt or Pert chart in a project planning tool&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></representationOptions>
