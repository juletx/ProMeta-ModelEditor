  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Developing the team is part of executing the project. Improve the interactions and trust between team members,&#xD;
    incorporating team building into project activities, and empowering the team to make decisions. Management is done by&#xD;
    objectives and not by time reporting.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Help the team meet the iteration objectives by removing constraints, and by monitoring the progress and work remaining&#xD;
    to completion. When the team is falling behind, help the team assess how it can reduce work and still meet the&#xD;
    iteration goals. Involve stakeholders in approving changes and actions that affect them, so that their objectives for&#xD;
    the iteration can be met, and the issues they raise can be solved throughout the iteration.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Select an approach for the collection of basic metrics: ideally, they are automatically generated from the tools at&#xD;
    hand, but can be manually assembled, or both. &lt;span&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Continuously monitor the iteration to ensure that it is progressing appropriately. Track the progress of the current&#xD;
    iteration by maintaining visibility on the status of the items that are being worked on during the iteration. In&#xD;
    particular, it is important to be able to understand how quickly the team is moving through the work scheduled for the&#xD;
    iteration, and how accurate the estimates were &lt;a class=&quot;elementlinkwithusertext&quot;&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Share information about the progress being made by having quick, frequent meetings with the entire project team. These&#xD;
    meetings are useful to understand what team members have accomplished since the last meeting, and what they plan to&#xD;
    accomplish before the next meeting. It also allows the team to identify any blocking issues. See &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;

    guid=&quot;_68JUYN8-Edyhmsbt0Xyl8A&quot;>[Collaboration Guidance]&lt;/a> for more information.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Track the status of each work item by using visual indicators of state information (for example: defined, completed,&#xD;
    accepted) in a wall or automated tool. Since iterations are typically fixed in duration, another primary way to gauge&#xD;
    progress is to continuously monitor current status and also estimate how much work remains. Plot an iteration burndown&#xD;
    chart on a daily basis in order to visualize progress on a given iteration. This chart is plotted with the total&#xD;
    estimates for all the items that are not yet started and the estimated remaining effort for any item in progress. See&#xD;
    &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Take corrective actions to adjust the course of the iteration if the burndown chart shows that the work will not be&#xD;
    finished as planned.&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Because outside stakeholders do not participate in the daily activities of the team, it is important that the status of&#xD;
    the project should be communicated to them as often as possible. This communication significantly lowers the risk of&#xD;
    disconnect between the development team and the stakeholders. The status provides the team with data they can use to&#xD;
    improve their development process.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Besides the iteration status, the overall project status can be captured and communicated in a burndown report for the&#xD;
    whole project. This report should show the progress toward the release date, and should be updated at the end of every&#xD;
    iteration (when metrics, such as the team's velocity, can also be provided). This allows the team to predict what it&#xD;
    can accomplish on the remaining project iterations. Other metrics (such as number of test cases passed) can also be&#xD;
    used to present iteration and project status.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Keep the status information visible to stakeholders and the project team at all times in a project workspace (walls or&#xD;
    automated tool), where stakeholders can come and experience first-hand the progress being made by the team.&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Know about the team's problems and issues and&amp;nbsp;focus on problems that are blocking progress. A quick, daily meeting&#xD;
    is usually a good way to monitor those problems and issues. Keep&amp;nbsp;a record of issues that have to be solved within&#xD;
    the team in the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;

    likely to take a lot of time to solve, capture it in the Work Items List so that it can be assigned to an individual.&#xD;

    Identify the cause and impact of problems and exceptions as they arise. Identify possible solutions for problems that&#xD;
    have an immediate impact on the short-term goals and objectives. Identify who needs to be involved in implementing the&#xD;
    solution. Define the corrective actions and implement them.&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>When a team is falling significantly behind, or critical problems occur that prevent the team from meeting the iteration&#xD;
objectives, it may be necessary to descope work to ensure that the team delivers a useful product increment by the end of&#xD;
the iteration, while maximizing stakeholder value. Work with the team and stakeholders to revise the Iteration Plan and, as&#xD;
necessary, reduce the emphasis on less critical tasks by postponing them to a subsequent iteration. In rare cases, if the&#xD;
iteration objectives still seem impossible to meet, the team might consider terminating the iteration or reformulating the&#xD;
iteration to a new objective.</sectionDescription>
