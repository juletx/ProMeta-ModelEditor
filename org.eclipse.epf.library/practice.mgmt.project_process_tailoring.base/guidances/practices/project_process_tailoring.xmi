    The purpose of this practice is to guide the project team on tailoring and deploying the process to be followed by the&#xD;
    team. The team also makes decisions such as how to use work products, what the project-specific guidelines are, and so&#xD;
    on. The tools to support the project are installed, configured, and used by the team.&#xD;
&lt;/p></problem>
  <application>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The best way to read this practice is to first familiarize yourself with its overall structure: what it is in it and&#xD;
    how it is organized.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The best place to start is with the &lt;strong>Key Concepts&lt;/strong> for the practice: those concepts that are critical to&#xD;
    understand in order to adopt the practice. Once you understand the key concepts, you can turn your attention to the&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Work Products&lt;/strong> produced by the practice. Then you can review the practices &lt;strong>Tasks&lt;/strong>. From&#xD;
    the work products and the tasks, you can access applicable guidance: guidelines and tool mentors associated with each&#xD;
    task provide details about how to perform the task. Templates and checklists associated with the work products guide&#xD;
    you in their completion and evaluation. You can also access the guidance provided by the practice directly, via the&#xD;
    &lt;strong>Guidance&lt;/strong> folder.&#xD;
&lt;/p></application>
