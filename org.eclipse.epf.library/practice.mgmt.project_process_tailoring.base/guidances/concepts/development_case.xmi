    The Development Case is used to&amp;nbsp;document the results of tailoring a process. It provides a mechanism for
    describing how a project has tailored a process for their specific project.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    In general, the development case typically refers to a standard process, often defined at an organization level, and
    then describes how that process has been tailored or specialized for the project.&amp;nbsp; This typically includes:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        Information about how the process varies from the standard process, and why (typically by identifying work products
        added or removed from the process)
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        What work products are reviewed at which milestones, and their level of completion
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        References to guidelines and information that the project wants to use in addition to the information contained in
        the main process.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        What reviews will be performed, and their level of formality.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        What approvals are required, by whom, and when.
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>
    The development case also includes information on what was tailored and why.
