    For a given process area, you may need to refine or adapt the organizational process to accommodate your project needs.
    The following are typical activities and key considerations when tailoring the Risk Management process area for your
    project:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        Refine&amp;nbsp;the approach to be used to identify risks, and how risks will be analyzed and prioritized.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Refine&amp;nbsp;the list of&amp;nbsp;potential sources of risk, as well as typical risk categories, and impacted
        stakeholders, which will help the team identify risks for the project.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>

        class=&quot;jazz-ui-SideNavigationLayout-contentArea&quot; dojoattachpoint=&quot;_contentArea&quot;>&lt;span
        class=&quot;jazz-ui-SideNavigationLayout-contentArea&quot; dojoattachpoint=&quot;_contentArea&quot;>Refine or adapt the risk management
        strategies that will be used in your project, including mitigation, avoidance, and/or prevention strategies for the
        most significant (&quot;Top 10&quot;) risks.&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/span>
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Refine how the status of each significant risk and its mitigation activities will be monitored. Refine the
        acceptability thresholds against which risks will be periodically compared in order to determine the need for
        implementing a risk mitigation plan. Refine how risk review and reporting schedules will happen, and what frequency
        of reviews your project requires.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        List specific groups or individuals involved in the project's risk management activities for your project, and
        provide a description of the tasks and responsibilities of each.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Specify the budget available in your project for managing project risks (when this information is not already
        included in the overall project budget).
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        List&amp;nbsp;tools and techniques that will be used in your project to store risk information, evaluate risks, track
        the status of risks or generate risk management reports.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        List&amp;nbsp;the risk items that have been identified in your project. Decide if this&amp;nbsp;will be&amp;nbsp;a link to a
        separate Risk List artifact for the project or not. Publish and keep visible a &quot;Top 10&quot; list of risks that are
        considered significant enough for the project to spend resources on their management.&lt;br />
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>
    &lt;br />
    &amp;nbsp;
