    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Unless the change is trivial, you need to educate the project members about the new Development Process, including any&#xD;
    guidelines, templates and/or tools. This can vary from an informal 2 hour presentation to more formal training,&#xD;
    depending on the size of the project and the project members' familiarity with similar development processes.&lt;br />&#xD;
    The following are commonly used ways to educate the project members:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Briefing&lt;br />&#xD;
        If the change is small or easy to understand a briefing to the team may be sufficient.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Mentors&lt;br />&#xD;
        Having experienced mentors or consultants on the project or available to the project is an effective way to provide&#xD;
        guidance on an as-needed basis.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Workshop&lt;br />&#xD;
        A one day process adoption workshop (PAW) for all project members can help &quot;kick-start&quot; a new or significantly&#xD;
        changed process. See Guidelines: Process Adoption Workshop&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Customized training courses.&lt;br />&#xD;
        If the project member have not attended the standard training courses in process and tools, an alternative is to&#xD;
        customize the standard training courses, to cover the project's development process, including guidelines,&#xD;
        templates and tools. However, it can be expensive to customize training courses. Generic process training, like an&#xD;
        introductory course to the Process or one or more practices, should be conducted prior to project startup, or in&#xD;
        the early days of the project. More specialized training in techniques, methods or technologies, is often conducted&#xD;
        &quot;just-in-time&quot;. This means that the training is given shortly before the method or technique is to be applied in&#xD;
        the project, to ensure that new knowledge is fresh in mind. &quot;Boot-camps&quot;.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        1-5 weeks of concentrated hands-on training. Not many organizations can afford to arrange these kinds of&#xD;
        boot-camps, but they have proven to be efficient if there are many new factors for the people in the project. A&#xD;
        boot-camp is typically a mixture of seminars, training courses and hands-on work with the process and tools.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

  <purpose>&lt;p>
    The purpose of this task is to:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        Ensure that the project members are properly introduced to the process.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Harvest any feedback on the process and refine the process, as necessary.
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></purpose>
