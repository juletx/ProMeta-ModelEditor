    Introduction&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;i>Whole Team&lt;/i> refers to the organization that delivers software for a project, and it includes any and all&#xD;
    contributors (both direct and indirect participants) to the delivery. It creates a collaborative environment in which&#xD;
    the &quot;whole&quot; team participates in setting direction, managing work efforts, and delivering the solution. Successful&#xD;
    software delivery ultimately depends on people. This dependence means that the way people work together is a critical&#xD;
    success factor.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Background&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In some approaches to software development, customers and development managers tell developers what they want, when&#xD;
    they want it, and how much it can cost. Assignments are handed out and deadlines set without discussion. This&#xD;
    environment creates resentment among developers, managers, and customers. Developers also are asked or even expected to&#xD;
    work whatever hours it takes to get the job done. In addition, barriers exist or are created between teams, causing&#xD;
    team members to blame each other or pass the problem onto someone else.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Definition&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Whole Team embraces the concept that to be successful in terms of quality, schedule, and scope, people must feel&#xD;
    empowered to accomplish the project goals. This empowerment also means that the ultimate customer of the software must&#xD;
    be an active and equal participant in the process. The Whole Team process focuses on the collaboration among all team&#xD;
    members and the joint decision-making process. This approach creates an environment that ensures transparency and&#xD;
    promotes collaboration on related work items. Additionally, the active involvement of end users, customers, and&#xD;
    sponsors in the development process enhances the quality of the delivered product.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Misconceptions&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Whole team does not mean that the entire team works on everything at once, as the name suggests. The real goal with the&#xD;
    Whole Team approach is to ensure that the team works collectively to identify risks and to assign, deliver, test, and&#xD;
    review work products.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Key aspects&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Whole Team approach encompasses the following key ideas:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Collaboration across team members through: &#xD;
        &lt;ul>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Daily meetings&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Extended-team members&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Cross-functional teams organized around components&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Enabling technologies&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;/ul>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Sustainable pace&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Work assignments are pulled instead of pushed&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Decision-making is made by people close to the decision&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Managers do not direct, but coach and lead&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Everyone participates and generates value&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Transparency of information and activities&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Open and honest communication&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Business benefits&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Whole Team practice enriches the software development environment, raising overall resource productivity and improving&#xD;
    software quality. The Whole Team approach creates transparency, enabling all team members to be aware of all other work&#xD;
    activities in the software development process. This transparency is of direct benefit to the end user for the software&#xD;
    product being developed.&#xD;
