    Team members work more effectively if they can influence what they do and how they do it, rather than operating in an&#xD;
    environment where they are told what to do. Giving the team the ability and responsibility to organize their work and&#xD;
    determine how to best meet their commitments motivates team members to do their best. This also helps them collaborate&#xD;
    to ensure that the right skills are applied to the appropriate tasks. Self-organization impacts many areas, including&#xD;
    how planning and commitments are made (by a team, not by individuals), how work is assigned (you sign up rather than&#xD;
    get assigned), and how team members view their roles in the project (team member first, job function second).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    guid=&quot;_rmBEkJjsEduad8I_c-ogIA&quot;>Self-organization&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;requires a few things to work:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Transparency and commitments are crucial to aid in team communication and to bring out the best in the team&#xD;
        members. Open communication about the team's commitments related to the iteration lifecycle and personal&#xD;
        commitments made relative to micro increments ensures that execution problems are vetted and the right people are&#xD;
        focused on solving them.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Coaching is required to help teams self-organize and to remove barriers for success. The assumption is that the&#xD;
        project manager is the coach. This requires that the project manager avoid a command-and-control style of&#xD;
        management in favor of a coaching style. This has been a key recommendation in management books for the last two&#xD;
        decades, but some project managers may still not be able to make that transition.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
