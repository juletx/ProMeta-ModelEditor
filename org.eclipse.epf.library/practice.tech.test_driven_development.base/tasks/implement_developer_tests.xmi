  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Developer testing is different from other forms of testing in that it is based on the expected behavior of code units&#xD;
    rather than being directly based on the system requirements.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is best to do this at a small scale, much smaller than the complete code base to be authored by a developer over the&#xD;
    course of an iteration. This can be done for one operation, one field added to a user interface, one stored procedure,&#xD;
    etc. As the code base is incrementally built, new tests will be authored and existing tests might be revisited to test&#xD;
    additional behavior.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>
  <keyConsiderations>&lt;ol>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Automate tests via a unit regression testing tool (for example, xUnit) so that tests may be run by developers&#xD;
        whenever they make changes to the code.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Test to the risk of the implementation element. For example, the more critical an element is, the more important it&#xD;
        is to test it thoroughly.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Pair with&amp;nbsp;team members with testing skills&amp;nbsp;in all steps of this task to gain insight on testing and&#xD;
        quality considerations.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ol>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The&amp;nbsp;[Project Work] is implicitly used in implementation tasks to manage which requirements or change requests are&#xD;
    being realized in the code.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Select the increment of work to be tested and identify developer test(s)&amp;nbsp;to verify that the software&#xD;
    implementation&amp;nbsp;being developed behaves correctly. One source for the expected behavior for an implementation&#xD;
    element is the software design.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In identifying the&amp;nbsp;tests or in any other part of this task, consider collaborating with a team member who is&#xD;
    well-versed in the issues of testing.&#xD;
